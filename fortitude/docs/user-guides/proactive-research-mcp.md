## <setup>Setup and Installation</setup>

### <automatic-setup>Automatic Setup (Recommended)</automatic-setup>

Claude Code automatically detects and configures Fortitude MCP tools when the system is installed.

**Verification:**
1. Open Claude Code
2. Type: "Show available MCP tools"
3. Look for proactive research tools in the list
4. Use any proactive tool to test connectivity

### <manual-setup>Manual Setup</manual-setup>

If automatic detection fails, configure manually:

**1. Check Fortitude Installation:**
```bash
# Verify fortitude is installed and accessible
which fortitude
fortitude --version
```

**2. Start MCP Server:**
```bash
# Start the MCP server (usually automatic)
fortitude mcp-server start --port 3000

# Check MCP server status
fortitude mcp-server status
```

**3. Configure Claude Code:**
Add to Claude Code configuration if needed:
```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "fortitude": {
      "command": "fortitude",
      "args": ["mcp-server", "start"],
      "env": {
        "FORTITUDE_MCP_ENABLED": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### <troubleshooting-setup>Setup Troubleshooting</troubleshooting-setup>

**Issue: Tools not appearing in Claude Code**
```bash
# Check MCP server logs
fortitude mcp-server logs --tail 50

# Restart MCP server
fortitude mcp-server restart

# Test MCP connectivity
fortitude mcp-server test-connection
```

**Issue: Permission errors**
```bash
# Check configuration directory permissions
ls -la ~/.fortitude/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 755 ~/.fortitude/
chmod 644 ~/.fortitude/config.toml
```

## <workflows>Common MCP Workflows</workflows>

### <development-session>Development Session Workflow</development-session>

**Starting Your Development Session:**
```
User: "I'm starting work on the user authentication module"

Claude: I'll help you set up proactive research for your authentication work.

[Uses proactive_start with auth-focused configuration]

‚úÖ **Development Session Started**

Proactive research configured for authentication development:
- Monitoring: Enhanced focus on security patterns
- Priority keywords: "auth", "security", "validation", "encryption" 
- Scan frequency: Every 2 minutes (active development)
- File focus: Authentication-related files prioritized

I'll watch for gaps in security best practices, authentication patterns, and compliance requirements as you code. Let me know if you need any specific research on authentication topics!
```

**During Development:**
```
[Automatic notification via MCP]

Claude: üîç **Gap Detected**

I noticed a TODO comment in your authentication code:
- File: `src/auth/validator.rs:67`
- Comment: "TODO: Add rate limiting for login attempts"
- Priority: High (security-related)

I've started research on "rate limiting patterns for authentication" and "login attempt security measures." Results should be ready in about 3 minutes.

Would you like me to prioritize this research or continue with your current work?
```

**Research Results Integration:**
```
[Automatic research completion notification]

Claude: ‚úÖ **Research Completed: Rate Limiting for Authentication**

I found comprehensive patterns for login rate limiting:

**Key Recommendations:**
1. **Sliding Window Rate Limiting**: Most effective for login attempts
2. **Progressive Delays**: Increase delay with failed attempts  
3. **IP + User Account Tracking**: Track both vectors
4. **Redis Implementation**: Fast, scalable storage for counters

**Code Example:**
```rust
pub struct RateLimiter {
    redis: redis::Client,
    max_attempts: u32,
    window_seconds: u64,
}

impl RateLimiter {
    pub async fn check_rate_limit(&self, identifier: &str) -> Result<bool, RateLimitError> {
        let key = format!("rate_limit:{}", identifier);
        let current_count: u32 = self.redis.incr(&key, 1).await?;
        
        if current_count == 1 {
            self.redis.expire(&key, self.window_seconds).await?;
        }
        
        Ok(current_count <= self.max_attempts)
    }
}
```

**Additional Resources:**
- OWASP Authentication Best Practices
- Redis rate limiting patterns
- Industry-standard delay algorithms

Would you like me to help implement this pattern in your authentication module?
```

### <code-review-workflow>Code Review Workflow</code-review-workflow>

**Pre-Review Setup:**
```
User: "I'm about to submit a PR for the payment processing module. Can you help me check for any knowledge gaps?"

- Keywords prioritized: "wasm", "webassembly", "wasm-bindgen", "js-sys"
- Research depth: Enhanced (more sources, detailed explanations)
- Confidence threshold: Lowered (catch more potential learning opportunities)
- Notification frequency: Immediate (faster feedback)

I'll actively research any WebAssembly patterns you encounter and provide educational context. Try creating some WASM code and I'll help identify learning opportunities!
```

**Learning Discovery:**
```
[While coding WebAssembly examples]

Claude: üí° **Learning Opportunity Detected**

I noticed you're working with `wasm-bindgen` in your code. I've found some knowledge gaps that might enhance your learning:

**Current Code Context:**
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
    fn alert(s: &str);
}
```

**Learning Opportunities:**
1. **Memory Management**: WASM linear memory vs Rust ownership
2. **Type Conversions**: Advanced `wasm-bindgen` type mappings
3. **Performance Patterns**: Optimizing Rust for WASM size and speed
4. **Debugging Techniques**: WASM debugging in browser dev tools

**Research Started:**
- "WASM memory management patterns with Rust"
- "Advanced wasm-bindgen usage patterns"  
- "WASM performance optimization techniques"

I'll have detailed explanations and examples ready in a few minutes. Want to continue coding or explore these concepts now?
```

## <integration-patterns>Advanced Integration Patterns</integration-patterns>

### <contextual-research>Contextual Research Integration</contextual-research>

Claude Code can automatically incorporate research results into its responses:

```
User: "Help me implement error handling for this function"

Claude: I notice you're working on error handling, and I just completed research on this topic! Let me combine my analysis of your code with the latest research findings.

[Automatically accesses recent research results]

Based on your code and current Rust error handling best practices I researched:

**For your specific function:**
```rust
// Your current code:
fn process_data(input: &str) -> String {
    // TODO: Add error handling
    input.to_uppercase()
}

// Recommended with error handling:
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum DataProcessingError {
    #[error("Invalid input format: {0}")]
    InvalidFormat(String),
    #[error("Processing failed: {0}")]
    ProcessingFailed(String),
}

fn process_data(input: &str) -> Result<String, DataProcessingError> {
    if input.is_empty() {
        return Err(DataProcessingError::InvalidFormat("Empty input".to_string()));
    }
    
    // Add your processing logic here
    Ok(input.to_uppercase())
}
```

This pattern follows the research findings I just completed on Rust error handling, using:
- Custom error types with `thiserror` for better error messages
- Result<T, E> return type for explicit error handling
- Descriptive error variants for different failure modes

Would you like me to help adapt this pattern to your specific use case?
```

### <real-time-collaboration>Real-time Research Collaboration</real-time-collaboration>

```
User: "I'm struggling with async Rust performance in this function"

Claude: I can see you're working on async performance. Let me start some targeted research while we look at your code together.

[Uses proactive_list_tasks to check existing research]
[Uses proactive_create_task for immediate research]

I've started immediate research on "async Rust performance optimization" with high priority. While that runs, let me analyze your current code...

[3 minutes later, automatic research completion]

Perfect timing! My research just completed with some highly relevant findings for your async performance issue:

**Research Results Applied to Your Code:**
1. **Async Function Overhead**: Your function creates unnecessary futures
2. **Blocking Operations**: I found blocking calls in your async context
3. **Concurrency Patterns**: Research suggests better patterns for your use case

**Specific Recommendations:**
```rust
// Instead of this (blocking in async):
async fn your_function() -> Result<String, Error> {
    let result = expensive_blocking_operation(); // ‚ùå Blocks async runtime
    process_async(result).await
}

// Use this (proper async pattern):
async fn your_function() -> Result<String, Error> {
    let result = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(|| {
        expensive_blocking_operation() // ‚úÖ Proper blocking task
    }).await?;
    process_async(result).await
}
```

This research-backed approach will significantly improve your async performance. Want me to help implement these patterns in your specific code?
```

### <project-specific-intelligence>Project-Specific Intelligence</project-specific-intelligence>

The MCP integration learns from your project patterns:

```
User: "Set up proactive research for this new microservice"

Claude: I'll analyze your existing project structure to configure optimal proactive research for your new microservice.

[Uses proactive_configure with project analysis]

‚úÖ **Project-Specific Configuration Applied**

Based on your existing microservices, I've configured:

**Detected Project Patterns:**
- Architecture: Event-driven microservices with Kafka
- Database: PostgreSQL with async-rust (sqlx)
- API: axum with OpenAPI documentation
- Testing: Integration tests with testcontainers
- Monitoring: Structured logging with tracing

**Optimized Research Focus:**
- Event sourcing patterns and best practices
- Database migration strategies for microservices  
- API versioning and backward compatibility
- Distributed tracing and observability
- Error handling across service boundaries

**Custom Gap Detection Rules:**
- Undocumented API endpoints (your team emphasizes API docs)
- Missing database transactions (pattern in your other services)  
- Event handling without dead letter queues
- Services without health check endpoints

This configuration matches the patterns I see in your other microservices and will help maintain consistency across your architecture.
```

## <troubleshooting-mcp>MCP Troubleshooting</troubleshooting-mcp>

### <common-mcp-issues>Common MCP Issues</common-mcp-issues>

**Issue 1: Tools Not Available**
```
User: "The proactive research tools aren't showing up in Claude Code"

Claude: Let me help troubleshoot the MCP tool availability issue.

This usually happens when:
1. **MCP Server Not Running**: The Fortitude MCP server may not be started
2. **Connection Issues**: Claude Code can't connect to the MCP server
3. **Configuration Problems**: MCP server configuration is incorrect

**Quick Diagnostics:**
- Check if `fortitude mcp-server status` shows "running"
- Verify Claude Code can access the MCP server port
- Look for error messages in Claude Code developer console

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Restart MCP server: `fortitude mcp-server restart`
2. Check logs: `fortitude mcp-server logs --tail 20`
3. Test connection: `fortitude mcp-server test-connection`

Would you like me to walk through these steps, or do you see any error messages I can help interpret?
```

**Issue 2: Slow Response Times**
```
User: "The proactive research tools are very slow to respond"

Claude: Slow MCP tool responses can indicate several issues:

**Common Causes:**
1. **High System Load**: Proactive research using too many resources
2. **Network Latency**: MCP server communication delays  
3. **Large Project Size**: Scanning many files takes time
4. **Database Performance**: Vector database queries running slowly

**Performance Optimization:**
- Reduce scan frequency: Increase gap detection interval
- Limit file monitoring: Focus on important directories only
- Adjust concurrency: Reduce max concurrent research tasks
- Enable performance mode: Use optimized settings

**Quick Fixes:**
```bash
# Reduce resource usage
fortitude proactive configure set gap_analysis.scan_intervals_seconds 600
fortitude proactive configure set background_research.max_concurrent_tasks 2
fortitude proactive configure set performance.resource_limits.max_cpu_percent 50
```

Would you like me to apply these optimizations or check your current performance metrics first?
```

**Issue 3: Authentication Errors**
```
User: "I'm getting authentication errors when using the MCP tools"

Claude: Authentication errors with MCP tools typically relate to API key configuration:

**Common Solutions:**

1. **Check API Key Configuration:**
   ```bash
   fortitude proactive configure show api.authentication
   ```

2. **Regenerate API Key:**
   ```bash
   fortitude proactive configure generate-api-key --name "Claude Code MCP"
   ```

3. **Update MCP Server Configuration:**
   ```bash
   fortitude mcp-server configure --api-key-file ~/.fortitude/mcp-api-key
   ```

4. **Restart MCP Server:**
   ```bash
   fortitude mcp-server restart
   ```

The MCP server needs proper API credentials to communicate with the proactive research system. Let me help you reconfigure authentication properly.
```

### <debug-mode>Debug Mode for MCP</debug-mode>

```
User: "Enable debug mode so I can see what's happening with the MCP tools"

Claude: I'll help you enable debug mode for better visibility into MCP tool operations.

**Enable MCP Debug Logging:**
```bash
# Enable debug mode
fortitude mcp-server configure set debug_enabled true
fortitude mcp-server configure set log_level debug

# Restart with debug logging
fortitude mcp-server restart --debug

# Follow debug logs
fortitude mcp-server logs --follow --level debug
```

**Claude Code Debug:**
Enable Claude Code developer console to see MCP communication:
1. Open Claude Code settings
2. Enable "Developer Mode" 
3. Open developer console (Ctrl+Shift+I)
4. Look for MCP-related messages in console

**Verbose Tool Execution:**
When using MCP tools, I can now provide detailed execution information:

[Uses proactive_status with debug information]

**Debug Information:**
- MCP call initiated at: 14:30:15.123
- Tool parameters: {"detailed": true, "metrics": true}
- MCP server response time: 245ms
- Data received: 2.3KB
- Processing time: 12ms

This debug information helps identify where delays or issues occur in the MCP communication chain.

### <efficient-usage>Efficient MCP Usage</efficient-usage>

**1. Batch Operations When Possible**
```
User: "Show me status, recent tasks, and notifications"

Claude: I'll get all that information efficiently with a single batch of MCP calls.

[Uses multiple MCP tools in parallel for efficiency]

Here's your complete dashboard:

üìä **System Status**: Running (3h 42m uptime)
üß† **Active Tasks**: 2 research tasks in progress  
üì¨ **New Notifications**: 3 unread items
‚ö° **Performance**: Normal (12% CPU, 456 MB RAM)

This batch approach is more efficient than making separate requests for each piece of information.
```

**2. Use Appropriate Detail Levels**
```
// Efficient for quick checks
User: "Quick status check"
Claude: [Uses proactive_status with minimal parameters]

// Detailed when needed
User: "I need a full system report"  
Claude: [Uses proactive_status with full detail and metrics]
```

**3. Configure Notifications Appropriately**
```
User: "I don't want to be interrupted during deep focus work"

Claude: I'll configure the system to respect your focus time.

[Uses proactive_configure for focus-friendly settings]

‚úÖ **Focus Mode Configured**
- Notifications: Batched (delivered every 30 minutes)
- Priority filter: High and Critical only
- Quiet hours: Extended during your focus blocks
- Background research: Continues but doesn't interrupt

You'll still get important updates, but they won't break your concentration.
```

### <project-integration>Project Integration Patterns</project-integration>

**1. Context-Aware Configuration**
```
User: "I'm switching from frontend work to backend API development"

Claude: I'll adjust the proactive research configuration for backend API focus.

[Uses proactive_configure with backend-specific settings]

‚úÖ **Switched to Backend API Configuration**

Updated focus areas:
- File priorities: .rs, .sql, .toml files prioritized
- Gap detection: API documentation, error handling, security
- Research keywords: "api", "security", "performance", "database"
- Monitoring: Enhanced for backend patterns

The system will now focus on backend development patterns and API best practices rather than frontend concerns.
```

**2. Team Collaboration Support**
```
User: "My team lead wants to see our proactive research metrics"

Claude: I'll prepare a team-friendly summary of your proactive research activity.

[Uses proactive_list_tasks and proactive_get_notifications with team metrics]

üìà **Team Metrics Summary**

**This Week's Activity:**
- Knowledge gaps identified: 23
- Research tasks completed: 19 (83% success rate)
- Documentation gaps found: 8
- Code quality improvements suggested: 15

**Impact Areas:**
- Security: 5 important gaps addressed
- Performance: 3 optimization opportunities identified  
- Documentation: 8 missing API docs flagged
- Testing: 4 test coverage gaps found

**Time Saved:**
- Estimated research time: 12 hours automated
- Background processing: No development interruption
- Knowledge discovery: Proactive vs reactive approach

This shows how proactive research is improving code quality and team knowledge without disrupting development workflow.
```

### <customization>Customization for Different Development Styles</customization>

**1. Minimalist Integration**
```
User: "I prefer minimal interruptions - just show critical issues"

Claude: I'll configure a minimalist integration that only surfaces critical items.

[Uses proactive_configure with minimalist settings]

‚úÖ **Minimalist Mode Activated**

You'll only receive notifications for:
- Critical security gaps
- High-priority TODO items marked as urgent
- Failed research tasks needing attention
- System errors requiring intervention

All other research continues in the background and can be accessed when you actively request updates.
```

**2. Power User Integration**
```
User: "I want full visibility and control over the proactive research system"

Claude: I'll set up power user mode with full visibility and control options.

[Uses proactive_configure with power user settings]

‚úÖ **Power User Mode Activated**

Enhanced capabilities enabled:
- Real-time research progress updates
- Detailed performance metrics always visible
- Advanced configuration options accessible
- Research task queue management
- Custom gap detection rules
- Full notification history and analytics

You now have complete control and visibility into all aspects of the proactive research system.
