# Fortitude Domain Principles

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the fundamental technology and design principles that underpin the Fortitude knowledge management platform. These principles guide all architectural decisions, implementation choices, and evolutionary paths for the platform.

## Core Design Philosophy

### The "Learning-First" Principle

Fortitude is built on the fundamental belief that **AI systems must learn and adapt continuously** to provide value. Every component, every API, and every data structure is designed with learning as a first-class concern.

**Implications:**
- All user interactions generate learning data
- System behavior adapts based on usage patterns
- Quality improves automatically over time
- Feedback loops are integrated throughout the architecture

### The "Context Preservation" Principle

Knowledge without context is mere information. Fortitude treats **context as data** and preserves it with the same rigor as primary research results.

**Implications:**
- Rich metadata accompanies all research results
- Decision history is preserved and accessible
- User preferences and team patterns are captured
- Contextual relevance drives search and recommendation algorithms

## Technology Stack Principles

### 1. Rust-First Architecture

**Principle:** Leverage Rust's performance, safety, and concurrency characteristics for all core components.

**Rationale:**
- **Memory Safety**: Eliminate entire classes of bugs without runtime overhead
- **Performance**: Achieve C-level performance with high-level abstractions
- **Concurrency**: Built-in async/await and fearless concurrency patterns
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem for web services, databases, and AI integration

**Implementation Decisions:**
```rust
// Example: Type-safe error handling throughout
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum FortitudeError {
    #[error("Research provider error: {0}")]
    Provider(#[from] ProviderError),
    #[error("Database error: {0}")]
    Database(#[from] sqlx::Error),
    #[error("Classification failed: {message}")]
    Classification { message: String },
}

// Example: Async-first design with proper error propagation
pub async fn research_query(
    &self, 
    query: ResearchQuery
) -> Result<ResearchResult, FortitudeError> {
    // Implementation leverages Rust's async ecosystem
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- **Learning Curve**: Steeper initial learning curve vs. Python/JavaScript
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Some AI/ML libraries less mature than Python equivalents
- **Development Speed**: Slower initial development vs. dynamic languages
- **Benefits**: Superior runtime performance, memory safety, and concurrency

### 2. Async/Concurrent by Default

**Principle:** All I/O operations are asynchronous, and the system is designed for high concurrency from the ground up.

**Rationale:**
- **Scalability**: Support 100+ concurrent requests with minimal resource usage
- **Responsiveness**: Non-blocking operations ensure system remains responsive
- **Efficiency**: Efficient resource utilization through cooperative multitasking
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with async AI provider APIs

**Implementation Decisions:**
```rust
// Example: Async trait definitions for all core operations
#[async_trait]
pub trait ResearchProvider {
    async fn research(&self, query: &str) -> Result<Vec<ResearchResult>, ProviderError>;
    async fn health_check(&self) -> Result<HealthStatus, ProviderError>;
}

// Example: Concurrent request handling with Tokio
pub async fn handle_concurrent_requests(
    requests: Vec<ResearchRequest>
) -> Vec<Result<ResearchResult, FortitudeError>> {
    futures::future::join_all(
        requests.into_iter().map(|req| async move {
            self.process_request(req).await
        })
    ).await
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- **Complexity**: More complex error handling and debugging
- **Resource Management**: Careful management of connection pools and timeouts
- **Testing**: More complex testing scenarios for concurrent behavior
- **Benefits**: Superior scalability and resource efficiency

### 3. Microservices Architecture

**Principle:** Decompose functionality into focused, independently deployable services.

**Architecture Components:**
- **fortitude-core**: Research and classification logic
- **fortitude-api-server**: JSON REST API with monitoring
- **fortitude-mcp-server**: MCP protocol integration
- **fortitude-cli**: Command-line interface
- **fortitude-types**: Shared type definitions

**Rationale:**
- **Scalability**: Scale individual components based on demand
- **Maintainability**: Focused codebases with clear boundaries

- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use optimal technologies

**Implementation Decisions:**
```rust
// Example: Clean service boundaries with shared types
pub struct ApiServer {
    research_service: Arc<ResearchService>,
    learning_service: Arc<LearningService>,
    monitoring_service: Arc<MonitoringService>,
}

// Example: Service communication through well-defined interfaces
#[async_trait]
pub trait ResearchService {
    async fn execute_research(&self, query: ResearchQuery) -> Result<ResearchResult, Error>;
    async fn get_research_history(&self, filters: HistoryFilters) -> Result<Vec<ResearchResult>, Error>;
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- **Operational Complexity**: More complex deployment and monitoring
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead

#[derive(OpenApi)]
#[openapi(
    paths(
        research_query,
        get_research_history,
        submit_feedback,
        get_learning_metrics
    ),
    components(
        schemas(ResearchQuery, ResearchResult, LearningMetrics)
    )
)]
pub struct ApiDoc;

// Example: Consistent error handling across all APIs
pub async fn research_query(
    State(app): State<AppState>,
    Json(query): Json<ResearchQuery>,
) -> Result<Json<ResearchResult>, ApiError> {
    // Implementation with consistent error handling
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- **Development Overhead**: More upfront design and documentation work
- **API Versioning**: Complex versioning and backwards compatibility
- **Performance**: Serialization/deserialization overhead
- **Benefits**: Better integration, testing, and long-term maintainability

**Implementation Decisions:**
```rust
// Example: Vector search with multiple fusion strategies
pub enum FusionStrategy {
    ReciprocalRankFusion { k: f64 },
    WeightedScoring { vector_weight: f64, keyword_weight: f64 },
    RankFusion { decay_factor: f64 },
}

pub struct HybridSearchResult {
    pub vector_results: Vec<SearchResult>,
    pub keyword_results: Vec<SearchResult>,
