## 🎯 Research Type Framework Discovery

### **Major Architectural Insight: Context-Aware Research**

Through research experimentation, we discovered that fortitude needs **multiple research modes** that match the cognitive load and decision context of the requesting system. This transforms fortitude from a "generic research tool" into a **cognitive assistant** that adapts its research style to match the user's mental model and current task context.

### **Research Request Types Framework**

#### **1. Decision Research**
**Context**: "Which technology should I choose?"  
**Cognitive Load**: High-level architecture decisions  
**Output**: Executive summary, decision matrix, clear recommendation  
**Length**: 300-500 words  
**Prompt Pattern**: Lead with recommendation, justify with key differentiators

#### **2. Implementation Research**
**Context**: "How do I build this specific thing?"  
**Cognitive Load**: Active development work  
**Output**: Working code examples, patterns, gotchas  
**Length**: 800-1500 words  
**Prompt Pattern**: Code-heavy with production considerations

#### **3. Troubleshooting Research**
**Context**: "Why isn't this working?"  
**Cognitive Load**: Problem-solving mode  
**Output**: Diagnostic steps, common issues, solutions  
**Length**: 200-400 words  
**Prompt Pattern**: Problem → Root causes → Solutions

#### **4. Learning Research**
**Context**: "I need to understand this concept"  
**Cognitive Load**: Knowledge acquisition  
**Output**: Conceptual explanation, examples, mental models  
**Length**: 600-1000 words  
**Prompt Pattern**: Concept → Examples → Applications

#### **5. Validation Research**
**Context**: "Is this approach correct?"  
**Cognitive Load**: Confidence building  
**Output**: Best practices, trade-offs, alternatives  
**Length**: 400-600 words  
**Prompt Pattern**: Evaluate approach → Alternatives → Recommendation

## 🧪 Research Type Framework Prototyping Insights

### **Prototype Process Applied to Research Requirements**

We applied our research type framework to the 10 critical knowledge gaps in `research_needed.md`, categorizing each gap and modifying the research prompts accordingly. This prototyping process revealed several key insights about implementing the framework.

### **Research Type Distribution Analysis**

**DECISION Research (3 gaps):**
- Vector Database Options - Technology choice for system architecture
- Embedding Model Selection - Technology choice for semantic search capability  
- CLI Framework Alternatives - Technology choice for CLI framework and patterns

**IMPLEMENTATION Research (6 gaps):**
- Model Context Protocol Implementation - How to build MCP server functionality
- Alternative LLM Providers - How to build multi-provider architecture
- Caching and Storage Architecture - How to build scalable storage architecture
- Quality Evaluation and Validation - How to build quality evaluation systems
- API Design and Integration Patterns - How to build production API architecture
- Monitoring and Observability - How to build observability and monitoring systems

**LEARNING Research (1 gap):**
- Prompt Engineering Frameworks - Understanding prompt engineering concepts and patterns

### **Key Insights from Prototyping Process**

#### **1. Research Type Classification is Context-Dependent**
- **Insight**: The same topic can be different research types depending on the requester's current context
- **Example**: "Prompt Engineering" could be DECISION (which framework to choose), IMPLEMENTATION (how to build prompts), or LEARNING (understanding concepts)
- **Implication**: Context detection will be crucial for automatic classification

#### **2. Implementation Research Dominates Technical Systems**
- **Insight**: 60% of our knowledge gaps are IMPLEMENTATION type - "how to build X"
- **Pattern**: Once architecture decisions are made, most research becomes implementation-focused
- **Implication**: Implementation research templates need the most sophistication and code examples

#### **3. Length Targets Vary Significantly by Type**
- **DECISION**: 400-800 words (concise, focused on choice-making)
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: 1000-2000 words (comprehensive, code-heavy)
- **LEARNING**: 800-1200 words (conceptual, with examples)
- **Pattern**: Implementation research requires 2-3x more content than decision research

#### **4. Completion Guidelines Need Type-Specific Adaptation**
- **DECISION**: Focus on decision matrices, minimal examples, clear recommendations
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Focus on complete code examples, comprehensive error handling, testing
- **LEARNING**: Focus on conceptual explanations, mental models, related concepts
- **Pattern**: Each type needs fundamentally different success criteria

#### **5. Target Audience Shifts by Research Type**
- **DECISION**: "Technical decision-maker" - needs confidence to choose
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: "Developer implementing X" - needs working code and patterns
- **LEARNING**: "Developer learning X" - needs conceptual understanding
- **Pattern**: Audience cognitive context changes with research type

### **Framework Refinement Opportunities**

#### **1. Research Type Inference Patterns**
```rust
// Patterns discovered during classification:
- "Options", "vs", "comparison" → DECISION
- "Implementation", "how to build", "complete system" → IMPLEMENTATION  
- "concepts", "understanding", "patterns" → LEARNING
- "not working", "troubleshooting", "debug" → TROUBLESHOOTING
- "is this correct", "validate", "best practices" → VALIDATION
```

#### **2. Progressive Research Flow Patterns**
```rust
// Common progression patterns discovered:
DECISION → IMPLEMENTATION → VALIDATION
LEARNING → IMPLEMENTATION → TROUBLESHOOTING
DECISION → LEARNING → IMPLEMENTATION
```

#### **3. Output Format Specialization**
- **DECISION**: Decision matrices, comparison tables, clear recommendations
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Code examples, step-by-step guides, complete systems
- **LEARNING**: Conceptual explanations, mental models, example progressions

### **Implementation Strategy Refinements**

#### **1. Prompt Template Hierarchy**
```rust
// Base template + type-specific adaptations
struct PromptTemplate {
    base: BasePrompt,
    type_specific: ResearchTypeAdaptation,
    domain_specific: DomainAdaptation,
}
```

#### **2. Context-Aware Caching Enhancements**
```rust
// Cache key needs to include research type for accuracy
struct CacheKey {
    topic: String,
    research_type: ResearchType,
    context_domain: Domain,
    target_audience: AudienceType,
}
```

#### **3. Quality Metrics by Research Type**
- **DECISION**: Clarity of recommendation, alternative coverage, confidence score
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Code completeness, error handling coverage, production readiness
- **LEARNING**: Conceptual clarity, example relevance, understanding progression

## 🎯 Research Prompt Iteration Validation

### **Validation Process: Decision Research Prompt Testing**

We tested two refined decision research prompts against our framework expectations:
- **"New Quick" Prompt**: Technical decision-maker focused (500-800 word target)
- **"Executive Summary" Prompt**: Business decision-maker focused (300-500 word target)

Both prompts were applied to the same vector database selection topic to validate our research type framework assumptions.

### **Key Validation Results**

#### **1. Length Optimization is Transformative**
- **"New Quick"**: 171 lines (~500 words) - perfect for technical decisions
- **"Executive"**: 79 lines (~300 words) - perfect for executive decisions
- **Original comprehensive**: 932 words - overwhelming for decision-making
- **Insight**: Constraining length forces focus and dramatically improves usability

#### **2. Format Specialization is Critical**
- **"New Quick"**: Decision matrix with star ratings and weighted scores
- **"Executive"**: Ranked list with risk assessment and implementation roadmap
- **Pattern**: Same research type (DECISION) needs different formats for different audiences
- **Insight**: Format templates are essential for research type effectiveness

#### **3. Audience Adaptation Works Exceptionally Well**
- **Technical audience**: "Rust ecosystem maturity," "performance tier ranking"
- **Executive audience**: "Bottom line up front," "risk assessment," "implementation roadmap"
- **Pattern**: Same information, completely different presentation and language
- **Insight**: Audience context is as important as research type for prompt optimization

#### **4. Progressive Disclosure Pattern is Universal**
Both outputs follow the same information hierarchy:
1. **Immediate answer** (recommendation upfront)
2. **Supporting evidence** (comparison/ranking data)
3. **Implementation details** (examples/next steps)
- **Insight**: Progressive disclosure is a core pattern for decision research effectiveness

#### **5. Completion Guidelines Drive Quality**
Both outputs successfully demonstrate framework guidelines:
- **Decision matrices**: Clear comparison structures with scoring
- **Minimal examples**: Just enough code to demonstrate feasibility
- **Clear recommendations**: Both lead with the answer, then justify
- **Deal-breakers**: Both explicitly identify elimination criteria
- **Insight**: Type-specific completion guidelines are essential for consistent quality

### **Framework Refinement Discoveries**

#### **1. Decision Research Has Subtypes**
```rust
// Decision research needs audience-specific subtypes:
enum DecisionResearch {
    Technical { complexity: TechComplexity },
    Executive { business_context: BusinessContext },
    Architectural { system_scope: SystemScope },
}
```

#### **2. Format Templates Are Architectural Requirements**
- **Decision Matrix Template**: Star ratings, weighted scores, clear winners
- **Executive Brief Template**: Ranked options, risk levels, next steps
- **Comparison Table Template**: Side-by-side feature analysis
- **Insight**: Format templates should be first-class architectural components

#### **3. Context Layering Strategy**
```rust
// Context affects prompt construction in layers:
struct PromptContext {
    research_type: ResearchType,        // DECISION, IMPLEMENTATION, etc.
    audience_type: AudienceType,        // Technical, Executive, etc.
    domain_context: DomainContext,      // Technical systems, business strategy
    output_format: OutputFormat,       // Decision matrix, executive brief, etc.
}
```

#### **4. Quality Metrics Need Audience Awareness**
- **Technical Decision**: Accuracy of technical details, completeness of options
- **Executive Decision**: Clarity of business impact, actionability of recommendations
- **Pattern**: Same research type needs different quality validation approaches
- **Insight**: Quality metrics must be context-aware, not just type-aware

## 🏗️ Architectural Implications for Fortitude

### **1. Multi-Dimensional Prompt Classification**
Instead of simple research type classification, we need:
```rust
pub struct ResearchRequest {
    topic: String,
    research_type: ResearchType,
    audience_context: AudienceContext,
    business_domain: BusinessDomain,
    urgency_level: UrgencyLevel,
    expected_length: LengthTarget,
}
```

### **2. Template-Driven Response Generation**
```rust
pub struct ResponseGenerator {
    templates: HashMap<(ResearchType, AudienceType), ResponseTemplate>,
    formatters: HashMap<OutputFormat, ResponseFormatter>,
}
```

### **3. Context-Aware Caching Enhancement**
```rust
// Cache keys must include audience context for accuracy
struct CacheKey {
    topic: String,
    research_type: ResearchType,
    audience_context: AudienceContext,
    format_preference: OutputFormat,
    length_target: LengthTarget,
}
```

### **4. Progressive Disclosure Framework**
```rust
pub struct ProgressiveResponse {
    immediate_answer: String,           // Bottom line up front
    supporting_evidence: Vec<Evidence>, // Justification and comparison
    implementation_details: Vec<Step>,  // Next steps and examples
}
```

### **Integration Impact**

#### **For Claude Code Integration**
Claude Code can request research that matches its current cognitive context:
- **During architecture planning**: Decision research for technology choices
- **During implementation**: Implementation research for coding patterns
- **During debugging**: Troubleshooting research for problem-solving
- **During learning**: Learning research for concept understanding
- **During code review**: Validation research for approach verification

#### **For Proactive Mode Evolution**
When scanning project docs, fortitude can identify **what type of research gap** exists:
- Missing architecture decisions → Decision research
- Incomplete implementation guides → Implementation research  
- Unresolved technical debt → Troubleshooting research
- Knowledge gaps in team understanding → Learning research
- Unvalidated approaches → Validation research

#### **For MCP Server Design**
```rust
// MCP server can receive research type hints from Claude Code
pub struct MCPResearchRequest {
    topic: String,
    research_type: Option<ResearchType>,
    context: Option<String>,
    expected_output_length: Option<OutputLength>,
}
```
