## üéØ Research Priority Matrix

### **High Priority (Before MVP Implementation)**
1. **MCP Rust ecosystem** - Critical for Claude Code integration strategy
2. **Claude API rate limits and costs** - Essential for realistic usage planning
3. **File-based knowledge storage** - MVP foundation requirement

### **Medium Priority (During MVP Development)**
4. **Vector database comparison** - Needed for scaling beyond MVP
5. **Embedding model evaluation** - Critical for search quality
6. **Prompt engineering frameworks** - Essential for research quality

### **Lower Priority (Post-MVP)**
7. **Multi-LLM provider strategies** - Optimization and redundancy
8. **Advanced caching architectures** - Performance and cost optimization
9. **Quality evaluation frameworks** - Automated validation and improvement

## üî¨ Specific Research Questions Requiring Answers

### **Immediate MVP Concerns**
1. **Does a mature Rust MCP server library exist**, or do we need to implement the protocol from scratch?
2. **What are Claude API's actual rate limits and costs** for research-heavy workloads?
3. **How should we structure markdown files** for optimal AI consumption and searchability?

### **Architecture Decisions**
4. **How do embedding models perform specifically on technical documentation** and code-related content?
5. **What prompt patterns consistently produce high-quality research** across different technical domains?
6. **What caching strategies balance freshness vs. cost** for research results?

### **Quality and Integration**
7. **How can we implement intelligent request deduplication** across similar research topics?
8. **What metrics define successful research output** for AI consumption?
9. **How should fortitude communicate research results** back to requesting systems?

### **Scaling and Operations**
10. **What monitoring patterns provide actionable insights** for research system optimization?
11. **How can we implement automated quality validation** for research outputs?
12. **What backup and versioning strategies** protect the growing knowledge base?

## üìã Research Completion Checklist

For each research area completed:
- [ ] Research prompt executed with qualified AI research assistant
- [ ] Results documented in `docs/reference_library/` following established patterns
- [ ] Implementation examples validated and tested
- [ ] Integration patterns documented with error handling
- [ ] Performance considerations and limitations documented
- [ ] Research gap marked as resolved in this document

**Note**: These research requirements represent the difference between theoretical architecture and practical implementation. Systematic completion of these research areas will enable confident, production-ready fortitude development.
