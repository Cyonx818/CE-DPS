```

### <environment-preparation>Environment Setup</environment-preparation>
```yaml
Production Environment Checklist:
  - [ ] Production database backup completed
  - [ ] Environment variables configured
  - [ ] SSL certificates validated and current
  - [ ] Load balancer configuration updated
  - [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
  - [ ] Log aggregation setup verified
```

## <deployment-steps priority="high">Deployment Execution</deployment-steps>

### <step-1>Code Deployment</step-1>
```bash
# 1. Switch to deployment branch
git checkout sprint-001-implementation

# 2. Verify branch integrity
git log --oneline -5
git diff main...sprint-001-implementation --name-only

# 3. Build production artifacts
cargo build --release

# 4. Run final pre-deployment tests
cargo test --release
```

### <step-2>Database Migration</step-2>
```yaml
Migration Steps:
  - [ ] Review migration scripts for cache schema changes
  - [ ] Execute database migrations in staging environment
  - [ ] Validate migration success in staging
  - [ ] Execute production database migrations
  - [ ] Verify data integrity post-migration
```

### <step-3>Service Deployment</step-3>
```yaml
Deployment Sequence:
  - [ ] Deploy cache service updates
  - [ ] Deploy API server updates
  - [ ] Deploy MCP server updates
  - [ ] Verify service health checks
  - [ ] Update load balancer routing
```

## <post-deployment priority="high">Post-Deployment Validation</post-deployment>

### <health-checks>System Health Validation</health-checks>
```yaml
Health Check Targets:
  - [ ] Cache hit rate >85% within 1 hour
  - [ ] API response times <200ms (95th percentile)
  - [ ] Zero critical errors in logs
  - [ ] All service endpoints responding
  - [ ] Database connections stable
```

### <performance-monitoring>Performance Metrics</performance-monitoring>
```yaml
Key Metrics to Monitor:
  - cache_hit_rate: Target >85%
  - retrieval_time_avg: Target <200ms
  - concurrent_operations: Verify thread safety
  - error_rate: Target <0.1%
  - memory_usage: Monitor for leaks
```

## <rollback-plan priority="critical">Emergency Rollback Procedures</rollback-plan>

### <rollback-triggers>Rollback Decision Criteria</rollback-triggers>
**Immediate Rollback Required If**:
- Cache hit rate drops below 70%
- API response times exceed 500ms
- Critical errors exceed 1% of requests
- Data consistency issues detected
- Security vulnerabilities exposed

### <rollback-execution>Rollback Steps</rollback-execution>
```bash
# Emergency rollback procedure
git checkout main
cargo build --release
# Redeploy previous stable version
# Restore database from pre-deployment backup if necessary
# Verify system stability
```

## <monitoring-setup priority="medium">Production Monitoring</monitoring-setup>

### <alerts-configuration>Critical Alerts</alerts-configuration>
```yaml
Alert Thresholds:
  - cache_hit_rate < 80%: WARNING
  - cache_hit_rate < 70%: CRITICAL
  - api_response_time > 300ms: WARNING
  - api_response_time > 500ms: CRITICAL
  - error_rate > 0.5%: WARNING
  - error_rate > 1%: CRITICAL
```

### <dashboard-metrics>Monitoring Dashboard</dashboard-metrics>
```yaml
Key Dashboard Widgets:
  - Cache Performance: Hit rate, miss rate, eviction rate
  - API Performance: Response times, throughput, error rates
  - System Health: Memory usage, CPU utilization, disk I/O
  - Business Metrics: Knowledge retrieval success rate
```

## <business-validation priority="critical">Stakeholder Sign-off Required</business-validation>

### <approval-checklist>Business Validation Items</approval-checklist>
```yaml
