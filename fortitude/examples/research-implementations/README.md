# Research Implementation Examples

This directory contains Rust implementation code created during the research and development phase of the Fortitude project. These files represent working implementations of algorithms, patterns, and systems that were researched and documented in the reference library.

## Purpose

These implementations serve as:
- **Reference implementations** for concepts documented in `docs/reference_library/`
- **Working examples** of algorithms and patterns
- **Research artifacts** from the development process
- **Code examples** that complement the documentation

## File Organization

Each `.rs` file corresponds to research documentation in `docs/reference_library/research/`. For example:
- `Advanced Learning Algorithm Implementation.rs` → `docs/reference_library/research/advanced-learning-algorithm-implementation.md`
- `Classification Algorithms and Keyword Matching.rs` → `docs/reference_library/patterns/classification-algorithms.md`
- `Distributed AI System Observability.rs` → `docs/reference_library/research/distributed-ai-system-observability.md`

## Usage

These files are research implementations and may contain:
- Experimental code patterns
- Proof-of-concept implementations
- Algorithm prototypes
- System design explorations

They are provided as reference material and starting points for integration into the main codebase.

## Integration Notes

When integrating concepts from these files into the main codebase:
1. Review the corresponding documentation in `docs/reference_library/`
2. Adapt the code to fit the project's current architecture
3. Add appropriate tests and documentation
4. Follow the project's coding standards and patterns

## Dependencies

Each file includes its required dependencies in comments at the top. These may need to be added to the appropriate `Cargo.toml` file when integrating the code.
