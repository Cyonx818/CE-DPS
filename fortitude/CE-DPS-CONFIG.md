# CE-DPS Fortitude Configuration

## Overview

This Fortitude instance is configured specifically for the CE-DPS methodology to serve as the AI's persistent memory and pattern library for development workflows.

## Configuration for CE-DPS

### Knowledge Classification for AI Implementation

The classification system is adapted for CE-DPS AI implementation patterns:

```yaml
classification_types:

  - Troubleshooting: Error resolution and debugging guides for AI reference
  - Learning: Educational content and concept explanations for AI capability building
  - Validation: Testing patterns and quality assurance approaches for AI implementation
```

### Gap Detection for AI Development

Configured to detect knowledge gaps relevant to AI implementation:

```yaml
gap_detection:
  focus_areas:
    - Authentication and security implementation patterns
    - Database design and repository patterns
    - API design and validation approaches
    - Testing strategies and quality frameworks
    - Error handling and logging patterns
    - Performance optimization techniques
    - Deployment and operational patterns
  
  priority_scoring:
    security_patterns: 10
    testing_approaches: 9
    implementation_patterns: 8
    performance_optimization: 7
    documentation_patterns: 6
```

### Research Prioritization for AI Needs

Prioritizes research to support AI implementation capabilities:

```yaml
research_prioritization:
  ai_implementation_focus:
    - Security-first development patterns
    - Comprehensive testing approaches
    - Error handling and resilience patterns
    - Performance and scalability considerations
    - Code quality and maintainability standards
  
  human_oversight_support:
    - Business value measurement approaches
    - Strategic decision-making frameworks
    - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
    - Quality validation and approval processes
```

## CE-DPS Specific Features

```yaml
collaboration_learning:
  human_approval_patterns:
    - Architecture decision preferences
    - Feature prioritization criteria
    - Quality standards and expectations
    - Risk tolerance and mitigation approaches
  
  ai_implementation_patterns:
    - Successful code implementation approaches
    - Effective testing strategies
    - Security implementation best practices
    - Performance optimization techniques
```

### Knowledge Persistence

## Usage in CE-DPS

### For AI Assistants

1. **Pattern Lookup**: Query Fortitude for implementation patterns before creating new code
2. **Quality Validation**: Use Fortitude to validate code quality and security patterns
3. **Learning Integration**: Capture successful implementations for future reference
4. **Context Awareness**: Leverage project-specific knowledge for better implementations

### For Human Oversight

1. **Strategic Support**: Access research and analysis to support strategic decisions
2. **Quality Monitoring**: Track AI implementation quality and effectiveness
3. **Pattern Evolution**: Monitor how AI implementation patterns evolve and improve
4. **Knowledge Gaps**: Identify areas where AI needs additional knowledge or guidance

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: `cargo build --release`
2. **Initialize Knowledge Base**: `cargo run --bin fortitude-cli init`
3. **Configure for CE-DPS**: Copy configuration files to appropriate locations
4. **Start MCP Server**: `cargo run --bin fortitude-mcp-server`
5. **Verify Integration**: Test Claude Code integration with Fortitude

This configuration enables Fortitude to serve as the comprehensive knowledge management system for CE-DPS AI implementation workflows.
