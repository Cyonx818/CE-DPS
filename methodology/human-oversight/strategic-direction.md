# Strategic Direction Framework for CE-DPS

## Overview

This guide helps humans provide effective strategic direction to AI implementers in the CE-DPS methodology. The goal is to maximize AI implementation capabilities while maintaining human control over business outcomes and strategic decisions.

## Core Principles

### Human Strategic Authority
- **Vision & Goals**: Define project vision, business objectives, and success criteria
- **Architecture Approval**: Review and approve AI-designed system architecture
- **Feature Prioritization**: Select features and approve sprint scope
- **Quality Validation**: Ensure business value and strategic alignment

### AI Implementation Authority
- **Technical Research**: Comprehensive pattern analysis and technology evaluation
- **Code Implementation**: All coding, testing, and technical documentation
- **Quality Enforcement**: Automated testing, security validation, performance optimization
- **Knowledge Management**: Pattern capture and reuse through Fortitude integration

## Strategic Direction Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Planning (Human Strategic Input)

**Your Responsibilities:**
1. **Define Project Vision**
   - Business objectives and success metrics
   - Target user personas and use cases
   - Competitive landscape and market requirements
   - Budget and timeline constraints

2. **Set Strategic Constraints**
   - Technology preferences or restrictions
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Performance and scalability targets
   - Integration requirements with existing systems

3. **Approve Architecture**
   - Review AI-proposed system architecture
   - Validate against business requirements
   - Ensure alignment with long-term strategy
   - Consider maintenance and operational implications

**Example Strategic Input:**
```markdown
## Project Vision
Build a customer support portal that reduces support ticket volume by 40% 
through self-service capabilities while maintaining customer satisfaction scores above 85%.

## Strategic Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Salesforce CRM
- Response time under 200ms for all user interactions
- Support 10,000 concurrent users at peak
- GDPR compliance required for EU customers
- Budget: $150K development, $30K/month operational

## Architecture Approval
✅ Microservices architecture with API Gateway
✅ PostgreSQL for primary data storage
✅ Redis for session management and caching
❓ Need clarification on monitoring strategy
❌ Concerned about complexity of proposed event sourcing
```

### Phase 2: Sprint Development (Human Feature Selection)

**Your Responsibilities:**
1. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Select features for implementation based on business value
   - Balance technical debt against new functionality
   - Consider user feedback and market demands
   - Align with release strategy and milestones

2. **Sprint Scope Approval**
   - Review AI-created implementation plans
   - Validate effort estimates against timeline
   - Ensure realistic scope for team capacity
   - Approve technical approach and dependencies

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate business risks of proposed changes
   - Consider impact on existing users and systems
   - Plan rollback strategies for critical features
   - Approve deployment and testing strategies

**Example Feature Selection:**
```markdown
## Sprint 3 Priorities (Human Decision)
1. **HIGH**: User authentication with SSO integration
   - Critical for security compliance
   - Blocks other features requiring user context
   - Business value: Reduces onboarding friction

2. **MEDIUM**: Basic ticket creation and tracking
   - Core functionality for MVP
   - Business value: Enables self-service support

3. **LOW**: Advanced search with filters
   - Nice-to-have for user experience
   - Can be deferred if sprint runs long

## Approved Implementation Approach
✅ JWT-based authentication with 1-hour expiry
✅ Integration with existing Active Directory
✅ Progressive enhancement for mobile experience
❌ Skip advanced audit logging for now (add in later sprint)
```

### Phase 3: Implementation (Human Business Validation)

**Your Responsibilities:**
1. **Feature Review**
   - Test implemented features against business requirements
   - Validate user experience and workflow
   - Ensure integration with existing processes
   - Confirm feature meets acceptance criteria

2. **Business Value Assessment**
   - Measure feature impact against success metrics
   - Gather user feedback and satisfaction data
   - Assess alignment with strategic objectives
   - Plan optimization and iteration strategies

3. **Release Decision**
   - Approve features for production deployment
   - Set release timeline and communication strategy
   - Plan user training and change management
   - Monitor business metrics post-release

**Example Business Validation:**
```markdown
## Feature Review: User Authentication
✅ Single sign-on works with corporate credentials
✅ Password reset flow tested with real users
✅ Mobile experience acceptable on all target devices
✅ Performance meets 200ms response time requirement

## Business Value Assessment
- User onboarding time reduced from 15 minutes to 3 minutes
- Support tickets for password issues down 60%
- User satisfaction score improved from 3.2 to 4.1
- Ready for production release

## Release Approval
✅ Deploy to production Friday 2PM
✅ Notify users via email and in-app message
✅ Monitor for 48 hours before next feature release
✅ Success metrics look positive, continue with planned roadmap
```

## Effective Communication Patterns

### Providing Clear Requirements

**Good Example:**
```markdown
## Authentication Requirements
**Business Goal**: Reduce user onboarding friction while maintaining security
**User Story**: As a customer, I want to log in with my corporate credentials so I don't need another password
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Support SAML 2.0 integration with major identity providers
- Fall back to email/password for non-corporate users
- Remember login for 30 days on trusted devices
- Logout across all sessions when password changed in corporate directory
**Success Metrics**: 
- Onboarding time < 5 minutes
- Support tickets for login issues < 5/week
```

**Poor Example:**
```markdown
"Make the login better and more secure"
```

### Reviewing AI Proposals

**Effective Review Questions:**
- Does this architecture support our scalability requirements?
- How does this integrate with our existing customer data?
- What happens if this service goes down?
- How will we monitor and troubleshoot this in production?
- Does this create any compliance or security risks?

**Focus Areas for Review:**
- Business alignment, not technical implementation details
- Integration points with existing systems
- Operational and maintenance implications
- User experience and workflow impact
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Providing Feedback

**Constructive Feedback Pattern:**
```markdown
## Architecture Review Feedback

### Approved Elements
✅ Database schema design handles our data volume
✅ API design supports mobile and web clients
✅ Security model aligns with our compliance requirements

### Concerns Requiring Changes
❌ Proposed caching strategy may create data consistency issues
   - Business Impact: Users might see stale information
   - Suggested Alternative: Shorter cache TTL or event-based invalidation

❌ Single point of failure in authentication service
   - Business Impact: Complete system unavailable if auth service fails
   - Required: Add redundancy or graceful degradation

### Questions for Clarification
❓ How will we handle data migration from the existing system?
❓ What's the disaster recovery strategy?
❓ How will we train support staff on the new system?
```

## Decision-Making Framework

### When to Approve vs. Request Changes

**Approve When:**
- Business requirements are fully addressed
- Technical approach is reasonable and maintainable
- Risks are identified with appropriate mitigation
- Timeline and resource estimates are realistic
- Integration strategy is sound

**Request Changes When:**
- Business value is unclear or not maximized
- User experience doesn't meet expectations
- Technical approach creates unacceptable business risk
- Implementation doesn't align with strategic goals
- Operational complexity exceeds benefits

**Escalate When:**
- AI proposes major architectural changes
- Budget or timeline significantly impacted
- New compliance or security requirements discovered
- Integration challenges affect other business areas
- Scope creep threatens project success
