# Oversight Framework for CE-DPS

## Overview

This framework provides human project leaders with practical tools and processes for overseeing AI-driven development while maintaining strategic control and ensuring business value delivery.

## Oversight Principles

### Strategic Control with Tactical Trust
- **Strategic Decisions**: Humans make all business-critical decisions
- **Tactical Implementation**: AI executes within approved parameters
- **Quality Assurance**: AI implements comprehensive testing; humans validate business outcomes
- **Risk Management**: Humans assess business risk; AI implements technical safeguards

### Progressive Trust Building
- Start with closer oversight and gradually increase AI autonomy
- Base trust levels on demonstrated AI performance and consistency
- Maintain checkpoints at critical decision and implementation stages
- Adjust oversight intensity based on project complexity and business impact

## Three-Phase Oversight Model

### Phase 1: Planning Oversight (Strategic Approval)

**Human Oversight Activities:**
1. **Vision and Requirements Review**

2. **Architecture Decision Approval**
   - Review AI-proposed system architecture
   - Assess business implications of technical choices
   - Evaluate long-term maintenance and scalability
   - Approve or request modifications to architectural approach

3. **Roadmap and Timeline Validation**
   - Review AI-created feature prioritization
   - Validate timeline estimates against business needs
   - Ensure resource allocation aligns with strategic goals
   - Approve project scope and delivery milestones
