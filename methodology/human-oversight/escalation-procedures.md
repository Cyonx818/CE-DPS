# Escalation Procedures for CE-DPS

## Overview

This document provides clear procedures for escalating issues that exceed AI autonomous resolution capabilities or require human strategic intervention in the CE-DPS methodology.

## Core Escalation Principles

### When AI Should Escalate
- **Ambiguous Requirements**: Business requirements are unclear or contradictory
- **Strategic Decisions**: Choices that affect business direction or long-term architecture
- **Resource Constraints**: Timeline or budget limitations prevent quality implementation
- **Technical Blockers**: Issues that cannot be resolved within established patterns
- **Quality Gate Failures**: Repeated failures despite AI remediation attempts

### When Humans Should Intervene
- **Business Value Concerns**: Features not delivering expected business value
- **Strategic Misalignment**: Implementation deviating from business objectives
- **Risk Threshold Exceeded**: Business or technical risks exceed acceptable levels
- **Stakeholder Conflicts**: Disagreements requiring executive decision-making
- **External Dependencies**: Issues requiring vendor, partner, or third-party coordination

## Escalation Categories and Procedures

### Category 1: Technical Implementation Blockers

**Characteristics:**
- AI cannot resolve technical issues within established timeframes
- Implementation requires new technology or architectural patterns
- Performance or security requirements cannot be met with current approach
- Integration challenges affect system stability or functionality
