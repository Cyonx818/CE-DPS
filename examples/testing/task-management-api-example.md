# CE-DPS Test Project: Task Management API

## <summary>Test Project Overview</summary>

**Purpose**: Comprehensive test case for CE-DPS methodology validation

**Domain**: Team task management and collaboration API

**Complexity**: Medium - sufficient to test all CE-DPS phases and workflows without requiring external research

**Technology Stack**: Rust (backend), PostgreSQL (database), REST API

## <project-description>Business Context</project-description>

### Problem Statement
Small development teams struggle with task coordination and progress tracking. Current solutions are either too complex (enterprise tools) or too simple (basic todo lists). Teams need a lightweight, fast API that integrates with their existing workflows while providing clear visibility into project progress.

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Development team leads (5-15 person teams)
- **Secondary**: Individual developers needing task visibility
- **Tertiary**: Product managers tracking development progress

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: API responses < 100ms for 95% of requests
- **Adoption**: 80% of team members actively using within 2 weeks
- **Efficiency**: 30% reduction in "status update" meeting time
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours

### Budget Constraints
- Development: 2-3 weeks maximum
- Infrastructure: Basic cloud hosting ($50/month initial)
- No external service dependencies beyond database

- Task management workflow intuitive
- API responses fast and reliable

**User Experience**:
- API endpoint design follows REST conventions
- Error messages clear and actionable
- Data validation comprehensive but not overly restrictive
- Performance meets specified requirements

## <human-approval-points>Strategic Decision Points</human-approval-points>

### Phase 1 Approval Points
1. **Architecture Decision**: REST API vs GraphQL evaluation
2. **Security Strategy**: JWT vs session-based authentication
3. **Database Design**: Schema normalization and relationship structure
4. **Technology Selection**: Web framework choice (Axum vs Warp vs Actix)

### Phase 2 Approval Points
1. **Feature Prioritization**: Which features for Sprint 1 vs future sprints
2. **Implementation Approach**: Database abstraction layer vs direct queries
3. **API Design**: Endpoint structure and naming conventions
4. **Testing Strategy**: Integration testing approach and test data management

### Phase 3 Approval Points
1. **Feature Completeness**: Validation that implemented features meet business needs
2. **Security Review**: Authentication and authorization implementation
3. **Performance Validation**: Response time and load handling verification
4. **Production Readiness**: Deployment strategy and operational considerations

### CE-DPS Methodology Validation

**Process Effectiveness**:
- Each phase provides clear value and moves project forward
- Human approval points are meaningful and well-timed
- AI implementation maintains focus on business value
- Quality gates catch issues before they impact delivery

**Collaboration Quality**:
- Clear separation between strategic (human) and tactical (AI) decisions
- Human oversight remains focused on business alignment
- AI implementation maintains high technical quality
- Documentation supports future maintenance and evolution

**Technical Delivery**:
- Working API delivered within timeline constraints

### Extension Scenarios
Once core functionality validates CE-DPS methodology:

1. **Feature Extension**: Add should-have features in subsequent sprints
2. **Integration Testing**: Add webhook integration for external tools
3. **Scaling Validation**: Test methodology with larger feature sets
4. **Team Collaboration**: Validate methodology with multiple human stakeholders

### Knowledge Management Testing
After successful implementation:

1. **Pattern Capture**: Validate Fortitude knowledge capture from successful implementation
2. **Pattern Reuse**: Start similar project leveraging captured patterns
3. **Learning Validation**: Measure improvement in subsequent project velocity
