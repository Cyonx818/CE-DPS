# CE-DPS Example: REST API Development

## Overview

This example demonstrates applying CE-DPS methodology to develop a customer management REST API, showing how AI implements comprehensive API design while humans provide strategic business guidance.

## Phase 1: Strategic Planning (Human-Led)

### Business Requirements (Human Input)
```markdown
## Project Context
**Goal**: Create customer management API for internal tools and partner integrations
**Business Driver**: Enable partner integrations and reduce manual customer data entry
**Success Metrics**:
- Partner integration time < 2 weeks
- API response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime
- Support 1000 concurrent requests

## Strategic Requirements
- RESTful API with JSON responses
- Support CRUD operations for customers
- Pagination for large datasets
- Real-time search and filtering
- Audit trail for all changes
- Partner authentication via API keys

## Integration Requirements
- Read from existing customer database
- Integrate with existing authentication system
- Support existing data validation rules
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration

## Constraints
- Must use existing PostgreSQL database
- Deploy on current Kubernetes cluster
- Timeline: 4 weeks for MVP, 8 weeks for full features
- Budget: $75K development, $1K/month operational
```

### AI Architecture Analysis
```markdown
## API Architecture Analysis

### Proposed Design
- **Framework**: Rust with Axum for high performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens + API key authentication
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 with Swagger UI
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data

### API Design
**Base URL**: `https://api.company.com/v1`

**Endpoints**:
- GET /customers - List customers with pagination
- GET /customers/{id} - Get single customer
- POST /customers - Create new customer
- PUT /customers/{id} - Update customer
- DELETE /customers/{id} - Delete customer
- GET /customers/search - Search customers with filters

### Data Model
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "phone": "string",
  "address": {
    "street": "string",
    "city": "string",
    "state": "string",
    "zip": "string"
  },
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp",
  "status": "active|inactive|suspended"
}
```

### Security Design
- API key authentication for partners
- JWT authentication for internal tools
- Rate limiting: 1000 requests/hour per API key
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries

### Performance Strategy
- Database connection pooling (10-50 connections)
- Redis caching for frequently accessed customers
- Pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Database indexes on search fields
- Response compression for large payloads
```

### Human Architecture Review
```markdown
## Architecture Review Decision

### Approved Elements
✅ RESTful API design with proper HTTP methods
✅ PostgreSQL integration with existing database
✅ JWT and API key authentication approach
✅ Redis caching for performance
✅ Comprehensive input validation

### Requested Changes
❌ Add soft delete instead of hard delete (business requirement)
❌ Include customer history tracking (audit requirement)
❌ Add webhook support for real-time notifications
❌ Implement field-level permissions for partners

### Business Clarifications
❓ Which partners need read-only vs. read-write access?
❓ What customer data fields are sensitive and need special handling?
❓ How should we handle duplicate customers from different partners?

**Decision**: Approved with modifications
**Next Steps**: Proceed to Phase 2 with updated requirements
