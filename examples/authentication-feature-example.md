# CE-DPS Example: Authentication Feature Implementation

## Overview

This example demonstrates the complete CE-DPS methodology for implementing a JWT-based authentication system in a web application. It shows the AI-as-implementer approach with human strategic oversight across all three phases.

## Phase 1: Strategic Planning (Human-Led)

### Business Requirements (Human Input)
```markdown
## Project Context
**Goal**: Implement secure authentication for customer portal
**Business Driver**: Reduce support tickets for password issues by 60%
**Success Metrics**: 
- User onboarding time < 5 minutes
- Support tickets for login issues < 5/week
- User satisfaction score > 4.0/5
- 99.9% authentication uptime

## Strategic Requirements
- Support both email/password and social login (Google, Microsoft)
- Remember login for 30 days on trusted devices
- Password reset via email with secure tokens
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Mobile-responsive design

## Constraints
- Must integrate with existing PostgreSQL database
- Use existing Redis for session storage
- Deploy on AWS with existing infrastructure
- Timeline: 3 weeks for MVP, 6 weeks for full features
- Budget: $50K development, $500/month operational
```

### AI Architecture Analysis
```markdown
## System Architecture Analysis

### Proposed Architecture
- **Backend**: Rust with Axum web framework
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with user table extension
- **Session Storage**: Redis for token blacklisting and rate limiting
- **External Auth**: OAuth 2.0 integration with Google and Microsoft

### Security Design
- JWT tokens with 1-hour expiry, refresh tokens with 30-day expiry
- bcrypt password hashing with cost factor 12
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per minute, 20 attempts per hour
- HTTPS enforcement with secure cookie flags
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs

### Integration Strategy
- Extend existing user table with authentication fields
- Create middleware for existing API endpoints
- Implement session management compatible with existing frontend
- Add monitoring and alerting for authentication events

### Risk Assessment
- **Security Risk**: Token theft → Mitigation: Short expiry, refresh rotation
- **Performance Risk**: Database load → Mitigation: Connection pooling, caching
- **Availability Risk**: Single point of failure → Mitigation: Redis clustering
- **Compliance Risk**: GDPR violations → Mitigation: Audit logging, data retention
```

### Human Architecture Review
```markdown
## Architecture Review Decision

### Approved Elements
✅ JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
✅ Integration with existing PostgreSQL and Redis
✅ OAuth 2.0 for social login
✅ Security measures (bcrypt, rate limiting, HTTPS)

### Requested Changes
❌ Reduce JWT expiry to 15 minutes (higher security requirement)
❌ Add audit logging for compliance (required for GDPR)
❌ Include account recovery workflow (business requirement)

### Clarification Questions
❓ How will we handle existing user sessions during rollout?
❓ What's the disaster recovery plan for Redis failure?
❓ How will we train customer support on new authentication?

**Decision**: Approved with modifications
**Next Steps**: Proceed to Phase 2 with updated requirements
```

## Phase 2: Sprint Planning (AI-Led with Human Approval)

### AI Feature Breakdown
```markdown

**Dependencies**: Database schema, Redis configuration

### Implementation Plan
1. **Database Schema** (8 hours)
   - User authentication table extension
   - Migration scripts with rollback
   - Indexes for performance

2. **Authentication Service** (16 hours)
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Password hashing and verification
   - Refresh token rotation logic

3. **API Endpoints** (12 hours)
   - POST /auth/login
   - POST /auth/refresh
   - POST /auth/logout
   - GET /auth/me

4. **Security Middleware** (8 hours)
   - JWT validation middleware
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Audit logging system

5. **Testing** (20 hours)
   - Unit tests for all authentication functions
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Security tests for common vulnerabilities
   - Performance tests for concurrent users

### Quality Gates
- All tests pass with >95% coverage
- Security scan passes with no critical vulnerabilities
- Performance test handles 1000 concurrent users
- Audit logging captures all authentication events
```

### Human Sprint Review
