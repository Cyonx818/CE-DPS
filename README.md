## Core Principles

### Role Clarity

**Human Strategic Authority**:
- Project vision and business objectives
- Architecture approval and design decisions
- Feature prioritization and scope approval
- Business value validation and strategic alignment

**AI Implementation Authority**:
- Code implementation and technical execution
- Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
- Technical documentation and knowledge management
- Pattern application and continuous learning

### Quality Standards

**Security First**:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- SQL injection and XSS prevention
- Security vulnerability scanning

**Comprehensive Testing**:
- Test-driven development approach
- >95% test coverage requirement
- Unit, integration, and security testing
- Performance and load testing

**Documentation Excellence**:
- API documentation with examples
- Code comments explaining business logic
- Deployment and configuration guides
- Troubleshooting and error resolution guides

## Tools and Automation

### Quality Gates Script
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality validation
./tools/quality-gates.sh

# Features:
# - Code formatting and linting
# - Security vulnerability scanning
# - Test coverage analysis
# - Performance benchmarking
# - Documentation generation
```

### Phase Validator
```bash
# Validate phase completion
./tools/phase-validator.py --phase 1  # Strategic planning
./tools/phase-validator.py --phase 2  # Sprint planning
./tools/phase-validator.py --phase 3  # Implementation

# Generates comprehensive validation reports
```

### Fortitude Integration
```bash
# Query existing patterns
./tools/fortitude-integration.sh query "authentication patterns"

# Update knowledge base
./tools/fortitude-integration.sh update

# Generate reports
./tools/fortitude-integration.sh report
```

## Human-AI Collaboration

### Effective Communication Patterns

**Providing Clear Requirements**:
```markdown
## Authentication Requirements
**Business Goal**: Reduce user onboarding friction while maintaining security
**User Story**: As a customer, I want to log in with my corporate credentials
**Success Metrics**: Onboarding time < 5 minutes, Support tickets < 5/week
**Acceptance Criteria**: Support SAML 2.0, fallback to email/password
```

**Reviewing AI Proposals**:
- Focus on business alignment, not technical implementation details
- Evaluate integration points with existing systems
- Assess operational and maintenance implications
- Consider user experience and workflow impact

**Providing Feedback**:
```markdown
## Architecture Review Feedback
### Approved Elements
✅ Database schema design handles our data volume
✅ Security model aligns with compliance requirements

### Concerns Requiring Changes
❌ Proposed caching strategy may create data consistency issues
   - Business Impact: Users might see stale information
   - Required: Shorter cache TTL or event-based invalidation
```

### Escalation Procedures

**When AI Should Escalate**:
- Ambiguous business requirements
- Strategic architectural decisions
- Resource or timeline constraints
- Quality gate failures requiring business decisions

**Escalation Format**:
- Clear description of issue and business impact
- Analysis of options and trade-offs
- Specific decision or guidance needed
- Timeline for decision requirement
