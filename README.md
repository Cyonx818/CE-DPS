# CE-DPS: Context Engineered Development Process Suite

A comprehensive methodology that integrates AI implementation capabilities with human strategic oversight to accelerate development while maintaining quality and business alignment.

## Overview

CE-DPS combines the systematic approach of Development Process Solutions (DPS) with advanced Context Engineering techniques and Fortitude knowledge management to create a powerful AI-assisted development methodology. The core philosophy is **AI implements, humans provide strategic direction**.

### Key Benefits

- **Faster Development**: AI handles tactical implementation while humans focus on strategic decisions
- **Higher Quality**: Comprehensive testing and validation built into the AI implementation process
- **Better Alignment**: Human oversight ensures business value and strategic alignment
- **Continuous Learning**: Fortitude knowledge management captures and reuses successful patterns

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Git and a code editor
- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- Python 3.8+ (for phase-validator tool)
- Basic understanding of software development principles

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the CE-DPS methodology
git clone https://github.com/your-org/CE-DPS.git
cd CE-DPS

# Build the complete workspace
cargo build --workspace

# Set up Fortitude knowledge management
cargo run --bin fortitude-integration -- install

# Validate installation with quality gates
cargo run --bin quality-gates
```

### Your First CE-DPS Project

Getting started with CE-DPS is simple with the slash command interface:

1. **Initialize Your Project**
   ```bash
   /cedps-init
   ```
   This creates the project structure and prepares the environment.

2. **Check Status and Next Steps**
   ```bash
   /cedps-status
   ```
   Shows current phase and exactly what to do next.

3. **Start Phase 1: Strategic Planning**
   ```bash
   /cedps-phase1-setup
   ```
   Creates business requirements template at `docs/phases/phase-1-planning.md`.

4. **Define Your Vision**
   Fill out the template with:
   - What business problem are you solving?
   - Who are your target users?
   - What does success look like?
   - Technical requirements and constraints

5. **Get AI Analysis**
   ```bash
   /cedps-phase1-analyze
   ```
   AI performs comprehensive architectural analysis based on your requirements.

6. **Review and Approve**
   - Review AI-proposed architecture and implementation plan
   - Approve or request changes to the approach
   - Run `/cedps-phase1-validate` when ready

7. **Continue Through Phases** (Ongoing)
   - Follow `/cedps-status` guidance for Phase 2 and 3
   - AI implements code following CE-DPS patterns
   - You review and approve based on business value
   - Quality gates ensure production-ready code

## Methodology Overview

### The Three-Phase Approach

### Human Action Points

Each command clearly indicates when human action is required:

**Phase 1**: Fill business requirements → Review AI analysis → Approve architecture
**Phase 2**: Select sprint features → Review implementation plan → Approve approach  
**Phase 3**: Validate implemented features → Confirm business value → Approve production

### Quality Integration

Commands integrate seamlessly with quality gates:
- `/cedps-tools` runs comprehensive quality validation
- Each phase automatically runs appropriate quality checks
- Human approval required only after quality standards are met

## Human-AI Collaboration

### Effective Communication Patterns

**Providing Clear Requirements**:
Use the Phase 1 template created by `/cedps phase1 setup`:
```markdown
## Authentication Requirements
**Business Goal**: Reduce user onboarding friction while maintaining security
**User Story**: As a customer, I want to log in with my corporate credentials
**Success Metrics**: Onboarding time < 5 minutes, Support tickets < 5/week
**Acceptance Criteria**: Support SAML 2.0, fallback to email/password
```

**Getting Started**:
```bash
# Initialize project and get template
/cedps-init
/cedps-phase1-setup

# Fill out docs/phases/phase-1-planning.md with your requirements
# Then trigger AI analysis
/cedps-phase1-analyze
```

**Reviewing AI Proposals**:
- Focus on business alignment, not technical implementation details
- Evaluate integration points with existing systems
- Assess operational and maintenance implications
- Consider user experience and workflow impact

**Providing Feedback**:
```markdown
## Architecture Review Feedback
### Approved Elements
✅ Database schema design handles our data volume
✅ Security model aligns with compliance requirements

### Concerns Requiring Changes
❌ Proposed caching strategy may create data consistency issues
   - Business Impact: Users might see stale information
   - Required: Shorter cache TTL or event-based invalidation
```

### Escalation Procedures

**When AI Should Escalate**:
- Ambiguous business requirements
- Strategic architectural decisions
- Resource or timeline constraints
- Quality gate failures requiring business decisions

**Escalation Format**:
- Clear description of issue and business impact
- Analysis of options and trade-offs
- Specific decision or guidance needed
- Timeline for decision requirement

**Monitoring Progress**:
```bash
# Check current status and next steps
/cedps-status

# Run quality validation
/cedps-tools

# Get help if needed
/cedps-help
```
