# CE-DPS Phase 1 Validation

Validate Phase 1 strategic planning completion and authorize transition to Phase 2 sprint planning.

## Instructions

1. **Validate Phase 1 Completion Requirements**
   - Confirm `docs/phases/phase-1-planning.md` exists and contains complete analysis
   - Verify all business requirements sections are filled out by human or SKYNET
   - Check that AI analysis sections are populated with architectural recommendations
   - Ensure all required approval sections exist in the document

2. **Verify Strategic Approvals**
   - Check for Architecture Approval section with "✅ Approved" marker
   - Validate Feature Roadmap Approval section is approved
   - Confirm Risk Acceptance section shows approval
   - Verify Final Phase 1 Sign-off is complete
   - If SKYNET mode: auto-inject approval markers if missing with "✅ Approved - SKYNET: [best practice reasoning]"

3. **Run Phase Validation Tool**
   - If `tools/phase-validator.py` exists and python3 is available, run phase validation
   - Validate that all Phase 1 deliverables meet CE-DPS standards
   - Check documentation completeness and quality
   - Ensure strategic decisions are properly documented

4. **Validate Technical Foundation**
   - Confirm proposed architecture addresses all stated business requirements
   - Verify technology stack choices align with technical constraints
   - Check that feature roadmap prioritization matches business objectives
   - Ensure risk mitigation strategies are actionable and comprehensive

5. **Generate Phase 1 Completion Report**
   - Create `docs/phases/phase-1-completion-report.md` with comprehensive summary
   - Document approved architecture approach and key design decisions
   - Record final technology stack selections with rationale
   - Include complete feature roadmap with business value priorities
   - List all identified risks with approved mitigation strategies
   - Add completion metrics and quality validation results

6. **Update Project State for Phase 2 Transition**
   - If jq available: update `docs/ce-dps-state.json` with:
     - Add 1 to phases_completed array
     - Set phase_1_completed timestamp
     - Set ready_for_phase_2 = true
     - Update current_phase to 2
     - Update last_updated timestamp
   - If jq not available: warn about manual state management

7. **Handle SKYNET Auto-Transition**
   - If SKYNET mode: announce automatic progression to Phase 2 setup
   - Auto-inject any missing approval markers with best-practice reasoning
   - Display autonomous transition messaging
   - If not SKYNET: provide clear guidance for manual Phase 2 initiation

8. **Validate Phase 2 Readiness**
   - Confirm all Phase 1 artifacts are properly documented and approved
   - Verify project state correctly reflects Phase 1 completion
   - Check that strategic foundation is complete for sprint planning
   - Ensure human approval authority is maintained for strategic decisions

## Expected Behavior

Perform strict validation of Phase 1 completion with comprehensive approval verification. Generate detailed completion documentation and update project state. Handle both human oversight mode (requiring explicit approvals) and SKYNET autonomous mode (auto-approving with best-practice reasoning). Only authorize Phase 2 transition when all validation criteria are satisfied.
