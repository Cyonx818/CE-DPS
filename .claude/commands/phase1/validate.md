# CE-DPS Phase 1 Validation

Validate Phase 1 completion and prepare transition to Phase 2 sprint planning.

## Instructions

1. **Validate Phase 1 Requirements**
   - Check that docs/phases/phase-1-planning.md exists and is complete
   - Verify all business requirements sections are filled out
   - Confirm AI analysis sections are populated with detailed recommendations
   - Check for human approval markers (âœ… Approved) in review sections

2. **Verify Human Approvals**
   - Architecture Approval section must show "âœ… Approved"
   - Feature Roadmap Approval section must show "âœ… Approved"  
   - Risk Acceptance section must show "âœ… Approved"
   - Final Phase 1 Sign-off must be complete with name, title, date

3. **Validate Technical Foundation**
   - Confirm architecture addresses all business requirements
   - Verify technology choices align with constraints
   - Check that feature roadmap prioritization is complete
   - Ensure risk mitigation strategies are acceptable

4. **Generate Completion Report**
   - Create docs/phases/phase-1-completion-report.md
   - Summarize approved architecture and technology decisions
   - Document final feature roadmap with priorities
   - Record approved risk mitigation strategies
   - Include transition readiness assessment

5. **Update Project State**
   - Add 1 to phases_completed array in docs/ce-dps-state.json
   - Set phase_1_completed = true
   - Update current_phase = 2 (ready for Phase 2)
   - Add phase_1_completion_date timestamp
   - Update last_updated timestamp

6. **Prepare Phase 2 Transition**
   - Verify Phase 2 template availability
   - Check that all Phase 1 artifacts are properly documented
   - Confirm readiness for sprint planning activities
