# CE-DPS Phase 1 Analysis

Perform comprehensive AI analysis of business requirements and generate architectural recommendations.

## Instructions

1. **Validate Prerequisites**
   - Check that docs/phases/phase-1-planning.md exists
   - Verify business requirements sections are filled out by human
   - Ensure we're in Phase 1 (check docs/ce-dps-state.json)

2. **Read Business Requirements**
   - Parse problem statement and target users
   - Analyze success metrics and constraints
   - Review technical requirements and compliance needs
   - Extract budget and timeline constraints

3. **Query Fortitude for Patterns**
   - If available, search Fortitude knowledge base for similar architectural patterns
   - Look for proven solutions to identified problems
   - Research best practices for the technology stack

4. **Generate Architecture Analysis**
   - Propose system architecture based on requirements
   - Recommend technology stack with rationale
   - Design integration strategy for existing systems
   - Address scalability and performance requirements

5. **Create Implementation Strategy**
   - Break down development into phases
   - Identify technical dependencies and critical path
   - Estimate effort and timeline for major components
   - Plan team skill requirements

6. **Perform Risk Assessment**
   - Identify technical, business, and timeline risks
   - Propose mitigation strategies for each risk
   - Create contingency plans for critical risks
   - Assess feasibility and recommend adjustments

7. **Generate Feature Roadmap**
   - Prioritize features by business value and dependencies
   - Create detailed feature list with complexity estimates
   - Plan MVP and future iterations
   - Align features with business objectives

8. **Update Planning Document**
   - Fill in all AI analysis sections in the template
   - Provide detailed rationale for recommendations
   - Include research citations and pattern references
   - Mark document ready for human review

## Expected Output

```
ðŸ§  Performing CE-DPS Phase 1 Analysis...

âœ… Business requirements validated
âœ… Fortitude knowledge patterns researched
âœ… System architecture designed
âœ… Technology stack evaluated
âœ… Implementation strategy created
âœ… Risk assessment completed
âœ… Feature roadmap generated
âœ… Planning document updated

Phase 1 analysis complete!

ðŸ“Š Analysis Results:
   - Architecture: [Summary of proposed architecture]
   - Technology: [Key technology recommendations]
   - Timeline: [Estimated development timeline]
   - Features: [Number of features identified and prioritized]

ðŸ“‹ Document: docs/phases/phase-1-planning.md (updated with AI analysis)

Next Steps:
1. Human review of architectural recommendations
2. Approval/feedback on technology choices
3. Validation of feature roadmap priorities
4. Run /project:phase1:validate when human review complete
```

## Notes
- Focus on thorough analysis based on human-provided requirements
- Use Fortitude patterns when available for proven solutions
- Provide detailed rationale for all recommendations
- Prepare comprehensive foundation for Phase 2 planning
