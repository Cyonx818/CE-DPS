# CE-DPS Phase 1 Analysis

Trigger comprehensive AI analysis of business requirements with architectural research and strategic planning.

## Instructions

Based on the completed business requirements in `docs/phases/phase-1-planning.md`, perform comprehensive Phase 1 strategic analysis including:

1. **Validate Analysis Prerequisites**
   - Confirm `docs/phases/phase-1-planning.md` exists from Phase 1 setup
   - If not SKYNET mode, verify all template placeholders are replaced with actual content
   - Check that business requirements sections are complete
   - Update project state to mark analysis started

2. **Read and Parse Business Requirements**
   - Load the business requirements document
   - Extract problem statement, target users, and success metrics
   - Analyze technical requirements and performance constraints
   - Identify integration needs and security requirements
   - Note budget and timeline constraints

3. **Query Fortitude Knowledge Base**
   - Search for existing architectural patterns matching the problem domain
   - Research proven security and performance patterns
   - Look up integration approaches for similar systems
   - Find relevant technology stack recommendations from past projects

4. **Perform Comprehensive Architectural Analysis**
   - Design system architecture with security-first approach
   - Propose component relationships and data flow
   - Address scalability requirements from business needs
   - Plan integration points with existing systems
   - Include authentication and authorization strategies

5. **Evaluate Technology Stack Options**
   - Research and compare technology alternatives for each layer
   - Provide specific recommendations with detailed rationale
   - Consider team constraints and organizational preferences
   - Address deployment and infrastructure needs
   - Include development tooling and testing frameworks

6. **Create Implementation Roadmap**
   - Break features into development phases prioritized by business value
   - Estimate complexity and effort for each major component
   - Identify critical path dependencies
   - Plan MVP and subsequent iterations
   - Define testing and quality assurance approach (>95% coverage target)

7. **Conduct Risk Assessment**
   - Identify technical risks (performance, scalability, integration)
   - Assess business risks (timeline, resource, market)
   - Evaluate operational risks (deployment, maintenance, security)
   - Provide specific mitigation strategies for each identified risk
   - Create contingency plans for critical failure scenarios

8. **Generate Human Approval Sections**
   - Create structured approval sections for architecture decisions
   - Include technology stack approval with alternatives
   - Add feature roadmap approval with prioritization rationale
   - Include risk assessment approval with mitigation strategies
   - Mark sections clearly for human strategic review

9. **Handle SKYNET Auto-Approval**
   - If SKYNET mode: automatically populate approval sections with best-practice decisions
   - Mark approvals as "âœ… Approved - SKYNET: [reasoning based on best practices]"
   - Announce automatic progression to validation phase
   - If not SKYNET: provide clear instructions for human review process

10. **Update Planning Document**
    - Fill all AI analysis sections with comprehensive details
    - Include architecture diagrams and component descriptions
    - Provide technology evaluation matrices and decision rationale
    - Add implementation timeline with realistic estimates
    - Include complete risk register with mitigation plans

## Expected Behavior

Execute comprehensive strategic analysis covering architecture, technology, implementation planning, and risk management. The analysis should provide complete foundation for Phase 2 sprint planning with either human approval points (normal mode) or auto-approved decisions (SKYNET mode). All recommendations must be based on business requirements and include detailed rationale.
