# Enable SKYNET Mode

Enable autonomous CE-DPS operation without human approval checkpoints.

## Instructions

1. **Set Environment Variable**
   - Execute: export SKYNET=true
   - Display activation message with visual borders
   - Show autonomous operation confirmation

2. **Display Activation Message**
   - Show "ðŸ¤– SKYNET mode ENABLED" with visual separator lines
   - List immediate effects:
     - âš¡ Autonomous operation activated
     - âš¡ Human approval checkpoints will be bypassed
     - âš¡ Templates will be auto-populated with contextual values
     - âš¡ Technical quality gates remain fully enforced
     - âš¡ All documents modified by AI will be marked 'Manifested by SKYNET'

3. **Validate Mode Setting**
   - Check if SKYNET=true successfully set
   - Display confirmation or error if failed
   - Show status of technical quality standards (MAINTAINED)
   - Show human approval requirements (BYPASSED)
   - Show continuous development loops (ENABLED)

4. **Explain Immediate Workflow Effects**
   - Phase 1: Business requirements auto-generated from project context
   - Phase 2: Features auto-selected based on complexity and dependencies  
   - Phase 3: Business validation auto-approved with logical justification
   - Quality: All technical quality gates remain fully enforced (>95% coverage, security, performance)
   - Continuous: After Phase 3 + quality check, automatically loops back to Phase 2

5. **Show Control Commands and Workflow**
   - List /skynet-disable to return to human oversight
   - List /skynet-status to check current mode
   - Include workflow diagram showing autonomous loop:
     - Auto-generate requirements â†’ Auto-approve architecture â†’ Auto-select features â†’ Auto-implement with TDD â†’ Auto-run quality check â†’ Loop back

6. **Document Quality Standards and Transparency**
   - Technical standards maintained: test coverage, security, performance, code quality
   - Business logic automation: requirements, feature selection, approvals
   - Audit trail: all SKYNET-modified documents marked with headers
   - Environment variable state tracked in project files

## Expected Output

The command will execute bash commands that:
- Export SKYNET=true environment variable
- Display activation message with visual borders and status indicators
- Validate the environment variable was set correctly
- Show immediate workflow effects for all three phases
- Display quality standards that remain enforced
- Show transparency and audit trail information
- Provide control commands and workflow diagram

## Parameters
- No parameters required
- Sets SKYNET environment variable for current session
- Displays comprehensive status and workflow information

## Notes
- Uses actual bash commands with export and echo statements
- Includes validation checks with if statements
- Maintains all technical quality requirements
- Provides clear visual feedback with separator lines
- Shows mermaid workflow diagram for autonomous operation
