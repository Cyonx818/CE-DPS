# Enable SKYNET Mode

Enable autonomous CE-DPS operation without human approval checkpoints.

## Instructions

1. **Set Environment Variable**
   - Set SKYNET=true for current session
   - This enables autonomous operation mode

2. **Display Activation Message**
   - Show clear confirmation that SKYNET mode is enabled
   - Explain what autonomous operation means:
     - Human approval checkpoints will be bypassed
     - Templates will be auto-populated with contextual values  
     - Technical quality gates remain fully enforced
     - Continuous development loops enabled

3. **Update Project State** 
   - Update docs/ce-dps-state.json to set:
     - "skynet_mode": "true"
     - "human_approval_required": false
     - "last_updated": current timestamp

4. **Explain Immediate Effects**
   - Phase 1: Business requirements will be auto-generated from project context
   - Phase 2: Features will be auto-selected based on complexity and dependencies
   - Phase 3: Business validation will be auto-approved with logical justification
   - Quality: All technical quality gates remain fully enforced

5. **Show Control Commands**
   - Mention `/skynet-disable` to return to human oversight
   - Mention `/skynet-status` to check current mode

## Expected Output

```
🤖 SKYNET mode ENABLED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚡ Autonomous operation activated
⚡ Human approval checkpoints will be bypassed
⚡ Templates will be auto-populated with contextual values
⚡ Technical quality gates remain fully enforced
⚡ All documents modified by AI will be marked 'Manifested by SKYNET'
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ SKYNET mode confirmed
📊 Technical quality standards: MAINTAINED
🚀 Human approval requirements: BYPASSED
🔄 Continuous development loops: ENABLED

Control commands:
- /skynet-disable: Return to human oversight
- /skynet-status: Check current mode status
```

## Notes
- Only update environment variable and state file
- Avoid complex shell scripting
- Focus on clear communication of what changed
- Maintain all technical quality requirements
