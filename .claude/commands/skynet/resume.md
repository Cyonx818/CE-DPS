## <summary priority="critical">TL;DR</summary>
- **Purpose**: Detect and recover from auto-compact interruptions in SKYNET mode
- **Core Benefits**: Seamless loop continuation, context regeneration, state restoration
- **Prerequisites**: Interrupted SKYNET loop with saved state in docs/skynet-loop-state.json
- **Output**: Restored autonomous operation with context continuation

## <instructions priority="high">Auto-Compact Recovery Process</instructions>

### <step-1>Detect Auto-Compact Interruption</step-1>
**Interruption Detection**:
- Check for existence of docs/skynet-loop-state.json
- Compare saved state with current environment
- Validate that recovery is needed

**Detection Instructions**:
1. Check if `docs/skynet-loop-state.json` exists using file system tools
2. If it doesn't exist, display "‚ùå No SKYNET loop state found. Use /skynet:enable to start." and exit
3. Read the file and extract the `skynet_active` field
4. Check current `SKYNET` environment variable using the Bash tool
5. If saved state shows `skynet_active` is not `true`, display "‚ùå No active SKYNET loop to resume. Use /skynet:enable to start." and exit
6. If current environment already shows `SKYNET=true`, display "‚úÖ SKYNET already active. Use /skynet:status for current state." and exit

### <step-2>Display Recovery Status</step-2>
**Recovery Announcement**:
- Show "üîÑ SKYNET AUTO-COMPACT RECOVERY" with visual borders
- Display interruption details and recovery plan
- Show last known loop position and next command

**Status Display Instructions**:
1. Display "üîÑ SKYNET AUTO-COMPACT RECOVERY INITIATED" with separator lines
2. Show "Auto-compact interruption detected and recovery starting..."
3. Read the loop state file and display:
   - Loop Position from `loop_position` field
   - Current Sprint from `current_sprint` field
   - Next Command from `next_command` field
   - Last Updated from `last_updated` field

### <step-3>Validate Project State Consistency</step-3>
**State Validation**:
- Check docs/ce-dps-state.json for consistency
- Validate sprint directories and files
- Verify git repository state
- Check for manual changes during interruption

**Consistency Checks**:
1. Check if `docs/ce-dps-state.json` exists - if not, display "‚ùå Project state file missing. Run /init to reinitialize." and exit
2. Check git working directory status: `git diff --quiet` - if dirty, warn about uncommitted changes
3. Check current sprint directory exists using loop state file data
4. Display any warnings found during validation

### <step-4>Restore Environment Variables</step-4>
**Environment Restoration Instructions**:
1. Use the Bash tool to execute: `export SKYNET=true`
2. Read the loop state file to get the saved CE_DPS_PHASE value
3. Use the Bash tool to execute: `export CE_DPS_PHASE=<saved_phase_value>`
4. Display "üîß Environment Variables Restored:" with the current values

### <step-5>Regenerate Working Context</step-5>
**Context Regeneration**:
- Read phase planning documents
- Scan implementation files for current state
- Review sprint goals and progress
- Rebuild understanding of current tasks

**Context Rebuilding**:
1. Display "üß† Regenerating Working Context..." message
2. Read current phase from docs/ce-dps-state.json using Read tool
3. Read current sprint from loop state file using Read tool
4. Check if sprint directory exists using LS tool: `docs/sprints/sprint-XXX/`
5. Display recent git activity: `git log --oneline -5`
6. Read sprint goals from sprint-info.json if available using Read tool

### <step-6>Update Loop State for Recovery</step-6>
**Recovery State Update**:
- Mark recovery as complete
- Update last execution timestamp
- Add recovery event to loop history

**State Update**:
1. Mark recovery as complete in the loop state file
2. Update last execution timestamp
3. Add recovery event to loop history:
   - Get current timestamp in ISO format
   - Update the loop state file to mark auto_compact_recovery as true
   - Set last_execution timestamp to current time
   - Add recovery action to loop_history array
   - Save the updated state back to docs/skynet-loop-state.json using the Edit tool

### <step-7>Execute Next Command in Sequence</step-7>
**Seamless Continuation**:
- Retrieve next command from loop state
- Display continuation message
- Execute next command automatically
- Resume autonomous operation

**Command Execution**:
1. Get next command from loop state using Read tool to read docs/skynet-loop-state.json
2. Get loop position from same file using Read tool
3. Display recovery completion message:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Recovery Complete - Resuming Autonomous Operation
   ==================================================
   Continuing from: [loop_position]
   Next command to run: [next_command]
   ```
4. Instruct user to manually execute the next command (slash commands cannot be auto-executed from bash)
5. If no next command, display "‚ö†Ô∏è  No next command specified. Use /project-status to determine next steps."

### <step-8>Display Recovery Summary</step-8>
**Recovery Completion**:
- Show recovery success message
- Display current loop status
- Show available control commands
- Confirm autonomous operation restored

## <expected-output priority="medium">Recovery Results</expected-output>

**Command Execution Flow**:
- Detect auto-compact interruption by comparing saved vs current state
- Display recovery status with last known position and next command
- Validate project state consistency and check for manual changes
- Restore environment variables (SKYNET=true, CE_DPS_PHASE)
- Regenerate working context from project files and git history
- Update loop state with recovery completion and timestamp
- Execute next command in sequence to resume autonomous operation
- Display recovery summary with current status and control commands

## <parameters priority="low">Command Configuration</parameters>
**Configuration Details**:
- No parameters required
- Reads from docs/skynet-loop-state.json for recovery state
- Uses jq for JSON parsing and git for repository state
- Automatically executes next command in autonomous sequence

## <implementation-notes priority="critical">Recovery Standards</implementation-notes>
**Critical Requirements**:
- **Complete state validation** before attempting recovery
- **Context regeneration** from multiple sources (files, git, state)
- **Seamless continuation** exactly where loop was interrupted
- **Safety checks** for working directory changes and consistency
- **Audit trail** of recovery events in loop history
- **Automatic execution** of next command to resume autonomy
