# Disable SKYNET Mode

Disable autonomous CE-DPS operation and restore human oversight checkpoints.

## Instructions

1. **Set Environment Variable**
   - Set SKYNET=false for current session
   - This disables autonomous operation mode

2. **Display Deactivation Message**
   - Show clear confirmation that SKYNET mode is disabled
   - Explain what human oversight restoration means:
     - Human approval checkpoints restored
     - Manual template completion required
     - Business validation requires human confirmation
     - Technical quality gates remain fully enforced

3. **Update Project State**
   - Update docs/ce-dps-state.json to set:
     - "skynet_mode": "false" 
     - "human_approval_required": true
     - "skynet_disabled": current timestamp
     - "last_updated": current timestamp

4. **Explain Immediate Effects**
   - Phase 1: Business requirements templates require manual completion
   - Phase 2: Feature selection requires human prioritization and approval
   - Phase 3: Business validation requires human confirmation of value delivery
   - Quality: All technical quality gates continue to be enforced
   - Progression: Manual command execution required between phases

5. **Show Workflow Return**
   - Explain return to standard CE-DPS collaborative workflow
   - Human strategic oversight restored
   - AI technical implementation authority maintained

## Expected Output

```
👨‍💼 SKYNET mode DISABLED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔒 Human oversight restored
🔒 Manual approval checkpoints reactivated
🔒 Template completion requires human input
🔒 Business validation requires human confirmation
🔒 Technical quality gates remain fully enforced
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ SKYNET mode disabled: Human oversight restored
📊 Technical quality standards: MAINTAINED
👨‍💼 Human approval requirements: RESTORED
⏸️ Continuous development loops: DISABLED

Human approval points restored:
✅ Business requirements definition and approval
✅ Architectural decision review and sign-off  
✅ Feature selection and sprint scope approval
✅ Implementation approach validation
✅ Business value confirmation for delivered features
✅ Production readiness assessment

Control commands:
- /skynet-enable: Enable autonomous operation
- /skynet-status: Check current mode status
```

## Notes
- Only update environment variable and state file
- Avoid complex shell scripting
- Focus on clear communication of restored human control
- Emphasize collaborative human-AI development model
