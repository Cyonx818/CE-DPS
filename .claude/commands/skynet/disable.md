# Disable SKYNET Mode

Disable autonomous CE-DPS operation and restore human oversight checkpoints.

## Instructions

1. **Set Environment Variable**
   - Execute: export SKYNET=false
   - Display deactivation message with visual borders
   - Show human oversight restoration confirmation

2. **Display Deactivation Message**
   - Show "üë®‚Äçüíº SKYNET mode DISABLED" with visual separator lines
   - List restoration effects:
     - üîí Human oversight restored
     - üîí Manual approval checkpoints reactivated
     - üîí Template completion requires human input
     - üîí Business validation requires human confirmation
     - üîí Technical quality gates remain fully enforced

3. **Validate Mode Disable**
   - Check if SKYNET=false or unset successfully
   - Display confirmation of human oversight restoration
   - Show status of technical quality standards (MAINTAINED)
   - Show human approval requirements (RESTORED)
   - Show continuous development loops (DISABLED)

4. **Explain Immediate Workflow Effects**
   - Phase 1: Business requirements templates require manual completion
   - Phase 2: Feature selection requires human prioritization and approval
   - Phase 3: Business validation requires human confirmation of value delivery
   - Quality: All technical quality gates continue to be enforced
   - Progression: Manual command execution required between phases

5. **Show Restored Human Approval Points**
   - List all approval checkpoints that are restored:
     - Business requirements definition and approval
     - Architectural decision review and sign-off
     - Feature selection and sprint scope approval
     - Implementation approach validation
     - Business value confirmation for delivered features
     - Production readiness assessment

6. **Display Standard CE-DPS Workflow**
   - Show mermaid workflow diagram for human oversight mode
   - Include manual command execution at each phase transition
   - Show human validation points throughout workflow

7. **Show Human Oversight Benefits**
   - Strategic authority maintained
   - Quality collaboration between human and AI
   - Risk mitigation through human validation
   - Collaborative human-AI development model

## Expected Output

The command will execute bash commands that:
- Export SKYNET=false environment variable
- Display deactivation message with visual borders and lock icons
- Validate the environment variable was set correctly
- Show immediate workflow effects for all three phases
- List all restored human approval points
- Display standard CE-DPS workflow diagram with human oversight
- Show benefits of human oversight and collaborative development

## Parameters
- No parameters required
- Sets SKYNET=false environment variable for current session
- Restores all human approval checkpoints and manual workflows

## Notes
- Uses actual bash commands with export and echo statements
- Includes validation checks with if statements for SKYNET=false or unset
- Maintains all technical quality requirements
- Provides clear visual feedback with separator lines
- Shows mermaid workflow diagram for human oversight mode
- Emphasizes collaborative human-AI development benefits
