# SKYNET Mode Status

Display detailed SKYNET mode information and operational status.

## Instructions

1. **Check Current SKYNET Status**
   - Read SKYNET environment variable value
   - Check docs/ce-dps-state.json for skynet_mode and human_approval_required settings
   - Determine if mode is explicitly set or using defaults

2. **Display Mode Information**
   - Show current SKYNET mode (enabled/disabled/unset)
   - Explain current operational behavior based on mode
   - Display when mode was last changed (if available in state)

3. **Show Operational Effects**
   - **If SKYNET=true (Autonomous Mode)**:
     - Human approval checkpoints: BYPASSED
     - Template auto-population: ENABLED
     - Continuous development loops: ENABLED
     - Business validation: AUTO-APPROVED with reasoning
     - Technical quality gates: MAINTAINED
   
   - **If SKYNET=false (Human Oversight)**:
     - Human approval checkpoints: REQUIRED
     - Template completion: MANUAL
     - Feature selection: HUMAN-DRIVEN
     - Business validation: HUMAN CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
     - Technical quality gates: MAINTAINED

   - **If SKYNET unset (Default Behavior)**:
     - Defaults to human oversight mode
     - All manual approval processes active
     - Standard CE-DPS collaborative workflow

4. **Show Control Commands**
   - Display available SKYNET control commands
   - Explain how to change between modes
   - Show status checking command

5. **Display Workflow Implications**
   - Explain how SKYNET mode affects each CE-DPS phase
   - Show what happens in autonomous vs. oversight modes
   - Describe quality standards that remain enforced regardless of mode

6. **Show Historical Information**
   - When SKYNET was last enabled/disabled (if available)
   - How long current mode has been active
   - Any relevant mode change history

## Expected Output

```
🤖 SKYNET Mode Status Report
============================

Current Status: [ENABLED/DISABLED/UNSET]
Last Changed: [timestamp or "Not available"]
Duration in Current Mode: [time duration]

🔍 Current Operational Mode
===========================

[If ENABLED:]
🟢 SKYNET MODE: ENABLED (Autonomous Operation)
   ⚡ Human approval checkpoints: BYPASSED
   ⚡ Template auto-population: ENABLED
   ⚡ Continuous development loops: ENABLED
   ⚡ Business validation: AUTO-APPROVED with reasoning
   ⚡ Technical quality gates: MAINTAINED
   ⚡ Document marking: All AI-generated docs marked "Manifested by SKYNET"

[If DISABLED:]
🟡 SKYNET MODE: EXPLICITLY DISABLED (Human Oversight)
   👨‍💼 Human approval checkpoints: REQUIRED
   👨‍💼 Template completion: MANUAL
   👨‍💼 Feature selection: HUMAN-DRIVEN
   👨‍💼 Business validation: HUMAN CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
   👨‍💼 Manual command execution between phases

[If UNSET:]
🔵 SKYNET MODE: NOT SET (Default: Human Oversight)
   👨‍💼 Operating in standard CE-DPS collaborative mode
   👨‍💼 All human approval processes active
   👨‍💼 Manual template completion required

🎯 Phase-Specific Behavior
==========================
Phase 1 (Strategic Planning):
- [Mode-specific behavior for Phase 1]

Phase 2 (Sprint Planning):
- [Mode-specific behavior for Phase 2]

Phase 3 (Implementation):
- [Mode-specific behavior for Phase 3]

🔧 Control Commands
===================
/project:skynet:enable  - Enable autonomous operation mode
/project:skynet:disable - Return to human oversight mode
/project:skynet:status  - Show this status information

📊 Quality Standards (Always Enforced)
=======================================
✅ >95% test coverage requirement
✅ Security-first implementation patterns
✅ Performance targets (<200ms response time)
✅ Comprehensive error handling
✅ Complete API documentation

🔄 Workflow Implications
========================
[Detailed explanation of how current mode affects workflow]

Environment Variables:
- SKYNET: [value]
