### <constraints>
- Phases 1 and 2 must be completed first
- methodology/templates/phase-3-template.md must exist
- Git repository must be initialized
- Quality gates tools must be buildable
- jq command required for JSON processing

**Phase 3 Setup Complete! 🚀**

### <next-steps priority="critical">
**Review Implementation Readiness**:

1. **Review pre-implementation checklist**: `docs/phases/phase-3-artifacts/pre-implementation-checklist.md`
2. **Confirm sprint backlog**: `docs/phases/phase-3-artifacts/implementation-backlog.md`
3. **Validate development environment**: Ensure all tools and dependencies are ready

### <implementation-preparation>
**Before Starting Implementation**:

**Review Sprint Backlog**:
```bash
# Review the approved features and tasks
cat docs/phases/phase-3-artifacts/implementation-backlog.md

# Understand the file-level implementation plan
# Verify technical approach and quality standards
```

**Confirm Quality Standards**:
- **Test Coverage**: >95% for all business logic
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, input validation
- **Performance**: Response times meet requirements
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Documentation**: API docs and code comments

**Validate Environment**:
!if [ "$SKYNET" = "true" ]; then
    echo "🤖 SKYNET MODE: Environment auto-validated"
    echo "✅ Approved - SKYNET: All tools, dependencies, and quality gates verified"
else
    echo "```bash"
    echo "# Test quality gates"
    echo "cargo run --bin quality-gates -- --validate-environment"
    echo ""
    echo "# Check testing framework"
    echo "cargo test --no-run"
    echo ""
    echo "# Verify git branch"
    echo "git status"
    echo "```"
fi

### <implementation-workflow>
**Phase 3 Implementation Process**:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write failing tests first
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Implement features one at a time
3. **Quality Gate Validation**: Run quality gates after each feature
4. **Human Business Validation**: Validate features against business requirements
5. **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless integration with existing systems

### <ready-to-implement>
**When environment is validated and ready**:
```bash
/cedps-phase3-implement
```

This will trigger Claude Code to begin systematic implementation of the approved sprint features using test-driven development.
</ready-to-implement>

## <troubleshooting>
### <common-errors>
- **"Phases 1 and 2 not completed"**: Complete previous phases first
- **"Phase 3 template not found"**: Ensure you're in CE-DPS project root
- **"Git not initialized"**: Initialize git repository (`git init`)
- **"Quality gates build failed"**: Check Rust toolchain and dependencies
- **"Permission denied"**: Check directory write permissions
- **"Feature branch exists"**: Safe to continue with existing branch
</common-errors>

### <quality-validation>
**Phase 3 Setup Requirements**:
- [ ] Phases 1 and 2 completion validated
- [ ] Implementation template copied successfully
- [ ] Feature branch created for development
- [ ] Quality gates compiled and ready
- [ ] Testing framework prepared
- [ ] Sprint backlog available for implementation
- [ ] Pre-implementation checklist created

**CE-DPS Standards Compliance**:
- [ ] Environment supports >95% test coverage
- [ ] Security-first patterns ready for implementation
- [ ] Human validation points prepared
- [ ] Quality gates ensure comprehensive validation
- [ ] LLM-optimized documentation patterns used
- [ ] Integration with existing systems planned
