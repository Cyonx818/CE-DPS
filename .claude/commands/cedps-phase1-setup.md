### <constraints>
- CE-DPS project must be initialized first
- methodology/templates/phase-1-template.md must exist
- docs/ directory must be writable
- jq command must be available for JSON processing
</constraints>

## <human-action-required>
**Phase 1 Setup Complete! üìã**

### <skynet-mode-check>
!if [[ "$SKYNET" == "true" ]]; then

### <next-steps priority="critical">
**You must now fill out the business requirements template**:

1. **Open the template**: `docs/phases/phase-1-planning.md`
2. **Complete ALL required sections**:
   - **Business Context**: Problem statement, target users, success metrics
   - **Strategic Requirements**: Must-have features, technical requirements
   - **Constraints**: Technology stack, timeline, budget limitations

### <template-sections-required>
**Business Context Section**:
```markdown
### Problem Statement
[Replace with: What business problem does this project solve?]

### Target Users  
[Replace with: Who are the primary and secondary users?]

### Success Metrics
[Replace with: How will you measure project success? Be specific.]

### Budget Constraints
[Replace with: Development budget and operational cost limits]
```

**Strategic Requirements Section**:
```markdown
### Business Requirements
- **Must-Have Features**: [List critical features that must be implemented]
- **Should-Have Features**: [List important but not critical features]
- **Could-Have Features**: [List nice-to-have features]

### Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: [Response time, throughput, scalability needs]
- **Security**: [Authentication, authorization, data protection needs]
- **Integration**: [Required integrations with existing systems]

### Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: [Required or preferred technologies]
- **Timeline**: [Fixed deadlines, dependency constraints]
```

### <validation-checklist>
**Before proceeding, ensure**:
- [ ] All `[Enter...]` placeholders are replaced with actual content
- [ ] Problem statement is clear and specific
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable
- [ ] Technical requirements are realistic
- [ ] Constraints are clearly defined
- [ ] Budget considerations are included

### <ready-to-proceed>
**When template is complete, run**:
```bash
/cedps-phase1-analyze
```

This will trigger Claude Code to perform comprehensive architectural analysis based on your requirements.
</ready-to-proceed>
</human-action-required>

## <troubleshooting>
### <common-errors>
- **"CE-DPS project not initialized"**: Run `/cedps-init` first
- **"Phase 1 template not found"**: Ensure you're in CE-DPS project root
- **"Permission denied"**: Check docs/ directory write permissions
- **"jq: command not found"**: Install jq for JSON processing
- **"Phase 1 already initialized"**: Delete existing file to restart
</common-errors>

### <quality-validation>
**Phase 1 Setup Requirements**:
- [ ] Template successfully copied to docs/phases/
- [ ] Environment variables set correctly
- [ ] Project state updated to Phase 1
- [ ] Fortitude integration prepared
- [ ] Human given clear next-step instructions

**CE-DPS Standards Compliance**:
- [ ] LLM-optimized semantic markup used
- [ ] Progressive disclosure implemented
- [ ] Security considerations documented
- [ ] Human approval points clearly marked
- [ ] Quality gate preparation complete
</quality-validation>
