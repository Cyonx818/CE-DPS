# CE-DPS Phase 3 Implementation

Execute comprehensive TDD implementation of approved sprint features with quality gates.

## Instructions

1. **Validate Implementation Readiness**
   - Check that Phase 3 environment is set up
   - Verify we're on the implementation branch
   - Confirm implementation plan is available and detailed
   - Ensure all quality gates are configured and active

2. **Execute TDD Implementation Process**
   - For each approved feature in dependency order:
     a. **Write Tests First**
        - Create comprehensive unit tests for business logic
        - Write integration tests for API endpoints
        - Add security tests for input validation
        - Create performance tests for critical paths
     
     b. **Implement Feature**
        - Write minimal code to make tests pass
        - Follow security-first implementation patterns
        - Implement comprehensive error handling
        - Add proper logging and monitoring
     
     c. **Refactor and Optimize**
        - Improve code quality and maintainability
        - Optimize performance to meet requirements
        - Ensure proper separation of concerns
        - Update documentation and comments

3. **Quality Gate Validation**
   - After each feature implementation:
     - Run complete test suite (must achieve >95% coverage)
     - Execute security vulnerability scanning
     - Perform performance benchmarking
     - Validate API documentation coverage
     - Check code quality and linting compliance

4. **Continuous Integration**
   - Commit feature implementations with comprehensive tests
   - Run automated quality validation pipeline
   - Update implementation tracking and metrics
   - Document any issues encountered and resolutions

5. **Feature Integration Testing**
   - Test feature interactions and integration points
   - Validate end-to-end workflows with new features
   - Perform regression testing to ensure no breakage
   - Test error handling and edge cases thoroughly

6. **Documentation Generation**
   - Update API documentation for new endpoints
   - Generate code documentation from comments
   - Create deployment guides for new features
   - Update troubleshooting documentation

7. **Implementation Progress Tracking**
   - Update implementation status for each completed feature
   - Track quality metrics and test coverage
   - Monitor performance benchmarks
   - Document lessons learned and patterns discovered
