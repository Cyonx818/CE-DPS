# CE-DPS Phase 3 Setup

Initialize Phase 3 implementation environment with TDD framework and quality gates.

## Instructions

1. **Validate Prerequisites**
   - Check that Phase 2 is complete (phases_completed contains [1,2])
   - Verify docs/phases/phase-2-completion-report.md exists
   - Confirm sprint branch exists (sprint-001-implementation)
   - Ensure implementation plan is detailed and approved

2. **Setup Implementation Environment**
   - Switch to implementation branch if not already there
   - Create docs/phases/phase-3-implementation.md from template
   - Initialize docs/phases/phase-3-artifacts/ directory
   - Set up docs/sprints/sprint-001/implementation/ tracking directory

3. **Configure Development Environment**
   - Set environment variables for Phase 3:
     - CE_DPS_PHASE=3
     - CE_DPS_IMPLEMENTATION_MODE=true
     - CE_DPS_TDD_REQUIRED=true
   - Verify development tools availability (compiler, test runner, linting)
   - Initialize continuous integration hooks if available

4. **Initialize Quality Gates**
   - Set up automated testing framework
   - Configure code coverage monitoring (>95% target)
   - Initialize security scanning tools
   - Set up performance benchmarking for new features

5. **Create Implementation Tracking**
   - Initialize docs/sprints/sprint-001/implementation/implementation-status.json
   - Set up feature completion tracking
   - Create test coverage monitoring
   - Initialize quality metrics collection

6. **Prepare TDD Framework**
   - Review selected features and implementation plan
   - Create test file structure based on Phase 2 planning
   - Set up test data and fixtures needed for implementation
   - Initialize anchor test framework for regression protection

7. **Setup Continuous Validation**
   - Configure automatic quality gate execution
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality
   - Initialize performance regression testing
   - Configure security vulnerability scanning

## Expected Output

```
ðŸš€ Setting up CE-DPS Phase 3: Implementation...

âœ… Prerequisites validated
âœ… Implementation environment configured  
âœ… Development tools verified
âœ… Quality gates initialized
âœ… TDD framework prepared
âœ… Implementation tracking setup
âœ… Continuous validation configured

Phase 3 environment initialized successfully!

ðŸ”§ Development Environment:
   - Branch: sprint-001-implementation
   - TDD Framework: Ready
   - Quality Gates: >95% coverage, security, performance
   - Implementation Plan: [Number] features ready

ðŸ“‹ Implementation tracking: docs/sprints/sprint-001/implementation/
ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3 document: docs/phases/phase-3-implementation.md

Quality Standards Enforced:
âœ… >95% test coverage required
âœ… Security validation on all inputs
âœ… Performance targets: <200ms response time
âœ… Comprehensive error handling
âœ… Documentation generation

Next Steps:
1. Run /phase3:implement to begin TDD implementation
2. Features will be implemented in dependency order
3. Quality gates will validate each feature before proceeding
4. Continuous testing and validation throughout

ðŸ’¡ Implementation will follow Test-Driven Development with quality gates
```

## Notes
- Ensure complete implementation environment setup
- Initialize all quality monitoring and validation systems
- Prepare comprehensive TDD framework
- Set up continuous validation for quality assurance
