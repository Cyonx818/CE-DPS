# CE-DPS Phase 2 Validation

Validate Phase 2 completion and prepare transition to Phase 3 implementation.

## Instructions

1. **Validate Phase 2 Requirements**
   - Check that docs/phases/phase-2-sprint-planning.md is complete
   - Verify features are selected with clear business justification
   - Confirm implementation plan has file-level detail
   - Check for human approval markers (âœ… Approved) in review sections

2. **Verify Human Approvals**
   - Feature Selection Approval must show "âœ… Approved"
   - Implementation Approach Approval must show "âœ… Approved"
   - Timeline and Resource Allocation must show "âœ… Approved"
   - Sprint Goal and Success Criteria must be approved

3. **Validate Implementation Readiness**
   - Confirm all selected features have detailed implementation plans
   - Verify technical dependencies are properly identified and sequenced
   - Check that testing strategy covers all quality requirements
   - Ensure resource allocation is realistic for timeline

4. **Create Sprint Environment**
   - Create implementation branch: `git checkout -b sprint-001-implementation`
   - Initialize sprint tracking in docs/sprints/sprint-001/
   - Set up quality gate automation and validation tools
   - Prepare development environment for TDD implementation

5. **Generate Phase 2 Completion Report**
   - Create docs/phases/phase-2-completion-report.md
   - Document approved feature selection with business rationale
   - Record final implementation plan with file breakdown
   - Include approved timeline and resource allocation
   - Document quality gate definitions and success criteria

6. **Update Project State**
   - Add 2 to phases_completed array in docs/ce-dps-state.json
   - Set phase_2_completed = true
   - Update current_phase = 3 (ready for Phase 3)
   - Add phase_2_completion_date timestamp
   - Update sprint information in docs/sprints/sprint-001/sprint-info.json

7. **Initialize Sprint Tracking**
   - Create implementation status tracking
   - Set up quality metrics collection
   - Initialize test coverage monitoring
   - Prepare for continuous integration validation

## Expected Output

```
âœ… Validating CE-DPS Phase 2 Completion...

ðŸ“‹ Requirements Validation:
   âœ… Feature selection complete and approved
   âœ… Implementation plan detailed and approved
   âœ… Timeline and resources validated
   âœ… Quality gates defined and approved

ðŸš€ Sprint Environment Setup:
   âœ… Implementation branch created: sprint-001-implementation
   âœ… Sprint tracking initialized
   âœ… Quality gates configured
   âœ… Development environment prepared

ðŸ“Š Completion Report Generated:
   - Features: [Number] features approved for implementation
   - Timeline: [Duration] sprint duration
   - Quality: >95% test coverage target, security validation
   - Files: [Number] files planned for creation/modification

ðŸŽ¯ Project State Updated:
   âœ… Phase 2 marked complete
   âœ… Current phase set to 3
   âœ… Sprint 001 initialized

Phase 2 Sprint Planning COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ“‹ Completion report: docs/phases/phase-2-completion-report.md
ðŸš€ Ready for Phase 3: Implementation

Next Steps:
1. Run /project:phase3:setup to initialize implementation environment
2. Begin TDD implementation of approved features
3. Execute comprehensive quality validation throughout

ðŸ’¡ Use /cedps-status to see updated project status
```

## Notes
- Strict validation of human approvals and implementation readiness
- Set up complete sprint environment for Phase 3
- Generate comprehensive completion documentation
- Initialize all tracking and quality systems for implementation
