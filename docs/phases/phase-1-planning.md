## AI Analysis Section

### Architecture Analysis
**System Architecture**: Rust-first microservices architecture with AI-first design principles. Core components include:

- **fortitude-core**: Research and classification logic with async/concurrent processing
- **fortitude-api-server**: JSON REST API with comprehensive monitoring and authentication
- **fortitude-mcp-server**: MCP protocol integration for Claude Code and compatible tools
- **fortitude-cli**: Command-line interface for automation and scripting
- **fortitude-types**: Shared type definitions ensuring consistency across components

**Integration Architecture**: Multi-protocol support including MCP for native Claude Code integration, REST API for custom integrations, and CLI for automation. Vector-first search architecture with Qdrant vector database for semantic search, hybrid search fusion combining vector and keyword approaches, and intelligent caching with multi-layer strategy.

**Security Architecture**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control, comprehensive input validation and sanitization, encryption at rest and in transit, and comprehensive audit logging for all operations.

### Technology Evaluation
**Core Technology Stack**:
- **Language**: Rust for performance, safety, and concurrency with async/await ecosystem
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data with SQLx for type-safe queries
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant for high-performance semantic search and similarity matching
- **Caching**: Redis for distributed caching with fallback to in-memory cache
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with configurable providers and role-based permissions
- **API Framework**: Axum for high-performance HTTP services with middleware support
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics with OpenTelemetry distributed tracing

**Technology Rationale**: Rust provides memory safety and performance without runtime overhead, essential for AI-powered services requiring high concurrency. The microservices architecture enables independent scaling and deployment. Vector-first search with Qdrant delivers superior semantic understanding compared to keyword-only approaches.

### Implementation Strategy
