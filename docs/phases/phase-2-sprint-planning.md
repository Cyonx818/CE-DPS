  - Mitigation: Use proven circuit breaker patterns, comprehensive unit testing
  - Contingency: Start with simple timeout-based fallback, evolve to full circuit breaker

- **Performance Impact** (Impact: Low | Probability: Low)  
  - Risk: Retry logic and circuit breaker add latency overhead
  - Mitigation: Optimize for happy path, measure performance impact
  - Contingency: Make retry/circuit breaker configurable, disable if needed

**Integration Risks:**
- **Provider Interface Changes** (Impact: Medium | Probability: Low)
  - Risk: Research provider interfaces may change during implementation
  - Mitigation: Design abstraction layer, minimize direct dependencies
  - Contingency: Create adapter pattern for interface compatibility

**Timeline Risks:**
- **Testing Complexity** (Impact: Medium | Probability: Medium)
  - Risk: Comprehensive failure scenario testing takes longer than estimated
  - Mitigation: Start testing early, use chaos engineering tools
  - Contingency: Focus on critical path testing, defer edge cases to future sprint
