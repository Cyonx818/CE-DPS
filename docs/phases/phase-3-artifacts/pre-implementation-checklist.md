# Pre-Implementation Checklist - Sprint 002

## ðŸ¤– SKYNET Phase 3 Setup Validation

### âœ… Environment Setup Verification
- [x] Phase 3 environment variables configured (CE_DPS_PHASE=3)
- [x] Quality gates tool compiled successfully  
- [x] Git feature branch created: `sprint-002-implementation`
- [x] Working directories created for implementation artifacts
- [x] Implementation tracking initialized

### âœ… Implementation Planning Validation  
- [x] Sprint backlog extracted to `docs/phases/phase-3-artifacts/implementation-backlog.md`
- [x] Feature focus confirmed: Core Research Pipeline Stabilization
- [x] Implementation plan validated: 17-day timeline with 3-week structure
- [x] All Phase 2 approvals completed with SKYNET reasoning

### âœ… Quality Standards Confirmation
- [x] Test coverage target: >95% for error handling logic
- [x] Security requirements: Input validation, no sensitive data in errors
- [x] Performance targets: <200ms response time, <10ms error handling overhead
- [x] Reliability target: 99.9% uptime under simulated failures
- [x] Quality gates tool ready for validation

### âœ… Human Validation Points Identified
- [x] Strategic implementation decisions automated via SKYNET
- [x] Business value validation will be performed autonomously
- [x] Code review and approval handled through quality gates
- [x] Sprint completion validation automated

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Readiness Status

**Status**: âœ… **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Next Action**: Execute `/phase3:implement` for autonomous TDD implementation of Core Research Pipeline Stabilization features.

**Implementation Approach**: 
- Week 1: Structured error types and retry logic with comprehensive testing
- Week 2: Circuit breaker implementation with state management  
- Week 3: Integration testing, load validation, and 99.9% uptime verification

**Quality Gates Active**: Automated validation at each implementation milestone with comprehensive testing and security verification.
