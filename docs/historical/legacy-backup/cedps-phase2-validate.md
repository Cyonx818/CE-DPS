## <summary priority="high">TL;DR</summary>
- **Purpose**: Validate Phase 2 sprint planning completion with human approvals and implementation readiness
- **Validation**: AI planning completion, human approval sections, no rejected items, sprint backlog extraction
- **SKYNET Support**: Auto-approves implementation plans when autonomous mode enabled
- **Output**: Phase 2 completion report, sprint backlog, updated project state, Phase 3 transition readiness
- **Requirements**: Phase 2 setup complete, AI planning done, strategic approvals present
