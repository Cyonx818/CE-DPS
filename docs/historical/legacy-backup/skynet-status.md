## <validation>Status Information Accuracy</validation>

This status command provides:
- **Current Mode**: Exact SKYNET environment variable state
- **Workflow Behavior**: How commands will behave in current mode
- **Quality Standards**: What remains enforced regardless of mode
- **Control Options**: Available commands to change operational mode
- **Next Steps**: Recommended actions based on current state

The information displayed reflects the actual runtime behavior of all CE-DPS slash commands based on the current environment configuration.
