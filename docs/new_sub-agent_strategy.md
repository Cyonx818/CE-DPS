## <summary priority="critical">TL;DR</summary>
- **Architecture**: Flattened 11-agent architecture with direct orchestrator control (nested subagents not supported)
- **Strategy**: Specialized agents with embedded CE-DPS methodology + parallel execution where possible + **localhost Fortitude API access**
- **Benefits**: Preserve orchestrator context window while maintaining CE-DPS quality standards and **independent knowledge management access**
- **Implementation**: 11 specialized agents across 3 phases with structured context packages, direct coordination, and **WebFetch-based Fortitude integration**
- **Success Criteria**: <40% orchestrator context usage with >95% agent task completion accuracy and **independent pattern lookup capability**

**Architecture Principles**:
- **Direct Control**: Orchestrator directly manages all 11 specialized agents
- **No Nesting**: Flat agent structure (nested subagents not supported by Claude Code)
- **Parallel Execution**: Research and planning agents execute in parallel for efficiency
- **Sequential Implementation**: Implementation agents execute sequentially for proper integration
- **Context Isolation**: Each agent operates in dedicated context window with focused expertise
- **ðŸ”‘ Independent Knowledge Access**: All agents access Fortitude knowledge management via MCP tools (inherited from main Claude Code instance)

## <implementation-plan priority="critical">Flattened Implementation Plan</implementation-plan>

### <phase-1-setup>Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup</phase-1-setup>

**Step 1: Verify Fortitude MCP Server Configuration**
```bash
# CRITICAL: Verify Fortitude MCP server is properly configured
# All subagents inherit MCP tools from main Claude Code instance

# Verify MCP server configuration exists
cat .mcp.json
# Should show:
# {
#   "mcpServers": {
#     "fortitude": {
#       "command": "cargo",
#       "args": ["run"],
#       "cwd": "fortitude/crates/fortitude-mcp-server"
#     }
#   }
# }

# Build and verify MCP server functionality
cd fortitude/crates/fortitude-mcp-server
cargo build

# MCP server will be started automatically by Claude Code when needed
# No manual server startup required for custom sub-agents
```

**Step 2: Create Custom Sub-Agent Configuration Files**

**Important**: Based on Anthropic's custom sub-agent documentation, sub-agents automatically inherit all MCP tools from the main Claude Code instance. No additional MCP configuration is needed in the custom sub-agent files.

**Sub-Agent Configuration Format**:
```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
# tools field is optional - omitting it inherits all MCP tools (recommended)
---

# Agent system prompt content here
```

**Step 3: Create Flattened Subagent Configuration Files**
```bash
# Create directory structure for flattened subagent configuration
mkdir -p .claude/subagents/prompts
mkdir -p .claude/subagents/config
mkdir -p .claude/subagents/context-templates

# Create configuration files for all 11 agents
touch .claude/subagents/config/ce-dps-architectural-researcher.yaml
touch .claude/subagents/config/ce-dps-security-researcher.yaml
touch .claude/subagents/config/ce-dps-performance-researcher.yaml

touch .claude/subagents/config/ce-dps-api-layer-implementer.yaml
touch .claude/subagents/config/ce-dps-quality-validator.yaml
```

**Step 3: Create System Prompt Templates**
```bash
# Create system prompt files for all 11 agents
touch .claude/subagents/prompts/ce-dps-architectural-researcher.md
touch .claude/subagents/prompts/ce-dps-security-researcher.md
touch .claude/subagents/prompts/ce-dps-performance-researcher.md

touch .claude/subagents/prompts/ce-dps-api-layer-implementer.md
touch .claude/subagents/prompts/ce-dps-quality-validator.md
```

**Step 3: Create Context Package Templates**
```bash
# Create context template files for flattened architecture
touch .claude/subagents/context-templates/phase1-research-context-template.yaml
touch .claude/subagents/context-templates/phase2-planning-context-template.yaml
touch .claude/subagents/context-templates/phase3-implementation-context-template.yaml

## <conclusion priority="low">Implementation Conclusion</conclusion>

This revised design document provides a comprehensive strategy for integrating Anthropic's new subagent features with the CE-DPS methodology using a flattened 11-agent architecture. This approach resolves the nested subagent limitation while preserving CE-DPS's proven coordination patterns and optimizing context efficiency.

**Key Success Factors**:
- **Flattened Architecture**: Direct orchestrator control of all 11 specialized agents eliminates nested delegation complexity
- **Parallel Optimization**: Research and planning agents execute in parallel for maximum efficiency
- **Sequential Integration**: Implementation agents maintain proper dependency management through sequential execution
- **Context Efficiency**: Orchestrator maintains minimal coordination state while agents focus on specialized tasks
- **Quality Preservation**: All CE-DPS quality standards maintained through specialized validation

**Implementation Priority**: High priority implementation recommended to optimize CE-DPS context efficiency and scalability while working within Claude Code's actual subagent capabilities.

**Architecture Validation**: This flattened approach has been validated against theoretical project requirements and confirms compatibility with CE-DPS methodology goals and usage patterns.
