# CE-DPS Project

## Overview
This project follows the CE-DPS (Context Engineered Development Process Suite) methodology for AI-assisted development with human strategic oversight.

## Development Phases
1. **Phase 1: Strategic Planning** - Define vision, approve architecture
2. **Phase 2: Sprint Planning** - Select features, create implementation plans
3. **Phase 3: Implementation** - Execute code development with quality gates

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Not started
- **Next Action**: Run `/cedps-phase1-setup` to begin strategic planning

## Quality Standards
- >95% test coverage required
- Security-first implementation patterns
- Comprehensive documentation with LLM optimization
- Human approval required for all strategic decisions

## Tools Integration
- **Fortitude**: Knowledge management and pattern lookup
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing and validation
- **Phase Validator**: Completion criteria verification
