# Sprint 002 Backlog - Core Research Pipeline Stabilization

## ðŸ¤– SKYNET Final Sprint Backlog:

1. **Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-5)**
   - Structured error type framework with thiserror
   - Basic retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Unit tests for error types and retry mechanisms

2. **Week 2: Advanced Resilience (Days 6-10)**  
   - Circuit breaker implementation with state management
   - Integration with retry logic and error types
   - Metrics collection and monitoring integration

3. **Week 3-4: Integration & Validation (Days 11-17)**
   - Comprehensive error reporting system
   - Integration testing for all failure scenarios
   - Load testing and 99.9% uptime validation
   - Documentation and final review

## Success Criteria

- âœ… 99.9% uptime target achieved under load testing
- âœ… All external API failures handled gracefully with fallbacks  
- âœ… >95% test coverage for error handling logic
- âœ… Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures in stress testing
- âœ… Structured error reporting provides actionable context
- âœ… Zero critical vulnerabilities in security scan
- âœ… Performance impact <10ms overhead for happy path

## Quality Gates

- **Code Quality**: Zero warnings, >95% test coverage, comprehensive error scenarios
- **Security**: Input validation, no sensitive data in errors, secure fallback handling  
- **Performance**: <200ms response time maintained, <10ms error handling overhead
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime under simulated failures, graceful degradation validated
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation, troubleshooting guides, runbooks
